# Quietkeep

**Out of sight. Never out of mind.**

> *It holds the rest, so you can rest.*

A free, local-first planner for people whose memory for intentions does not run
on willpower. It is built on one promise: **anything you put in comes back to
you.** Not because you remembered to look, but because the app is structurally
incapable of letting something go quiet.

> **Status: early — capture works.** The event-sourced spine and the first
> surface (capture, with the ⓘ panel and export) are live at
> **[quietkeep.pages.dev](https://quietkeep.pages.dev)**. Clarify, work mode, and
> everything after are still to come. The design record — decisions, the event
> vocabulary everything folds from, and the reasoning — is in this repository.
> See [`NOTES.md`](NOTES.md) for where things stand.

## What it is

- **Free**, and permanently so. No accounts, no subscription, no upsell.
- **Local-first.** Your data lives on your device. There is no server holding it,
  because there is no server.
- **No telemetry.** None. Not anonymised, not aggregated, not "to improve the
  product." If something breaks you may *volunteer* a diagnostic report.
- **Offline.** A static PWA. The network is never on the critical path.
- **Yours to leave.** Every byte exports to plain files you can read without us.

## What it refuses to be

- It will not score your mood, infer why you did or didn't do something, or use
  language borrowed from a diagnosis. It plots; you interpret.
- It has **no streaks and no overdue state.** A missed day is not a broken chain,
  and a passed date is not a failure to be filed away — it becomes a live card
  asking what you'd like to do now.
- It has **no archive of things you let slip.** There is no past bucket.
- It does not treat rest as a lapse. Coming back after a while away is a designed
  path, not an exception, and what greets you is bounded — never the backlog.
- It does not assume willpower is a tank that empties. The research that claimed
  so did not replicate, and nothing here is built on it.

- **[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md)** — What changed, written for the person using the app. Generated — the app's ⓘ panel shows the same notes

## Accessibility

WCAG 2.2 AA is the target, with COGA-informed patterns for the cognitive load
this app exists to reduce. Pressure and time are never encoded by color alone.
Shared statement across all of these apps:

Found a barrier? That is a bug report, and it is welcome.
