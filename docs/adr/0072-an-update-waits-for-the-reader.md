# ADR-0072 · An update waits for the reader

**Status:** Accepted · **Date:** 2026-08-04

## Context

`public/sw.js` called `self.skipWaiting()` inside its `install` handler, under
the comment *"Take over promptly: a half-updated shell is worse than a brief
wait."* That reasoning is exactly backwards, and it had been in this repo since
the first release.

**What `skipWaiting()` on install actually does.** It promotes the new worker
immediately — but it does not replace the page anybody is looking at. That page
carries on executing the PREVIOUS release's HTML and modules. Meanwhile the
`activate` handler below deletes every cache whose name is not the current one,
so from that moment every request the open page makes is answered with the NEW
file. Old markup, new modules, no reload, and nothing said to anybody.

That IS the half-updated shell the comment was trying to avoid. `skipWaiting()`
creates it rather than preventing it. Waiting produces the opposite: a reader
keeps a *consistent old app* until they choose to move, and an old app that
works is a smaller problem than a mixed one that does not.

**Where it came from.** Universal App Doctrine §7h, added 2026-08-03, states the
rule and names the measurement: Intersecting Parallels shipped this way for
twenty-two releases. The hub gate `pwa-check.mjs` catches it. Quietkeep had never
been run against either, because both landed in the hub after this repo last
reconciled — which is what `doctrine-sync.mjs` exists to surface and did.

**The awkward part, which is why this needed a decision rather than a patch.**
The update prompt was already built, and built *deliberately around*
`skipWaiting()`. `src/ui/update.ts` said so in its own header: the prompt "is
never 'apply the update' — it is 'there is a newer version than the one you are
looking at, and here is a moment to take a copy before you go to it'", and the
button read `Reload now` for that reason. The words were honest about a model
that was itself wrong. Fixing the worker without moving the model would have left
a control whose label described the old behavior.

## Decision

**The new worker waits, and only the reader's decision releases it.**

1. **No `skipWaiting()` in `install`.** The new worker installs, populates its
   cache, and waits.
2. **A `message` handler promotes it, checked by name** — `SKIP_WAITING` and
   nothing else. Not a timer, not `install`, not `activate`, and not a bare
   `postMessage` that any other code could trip.
3. **The page asks, then reloads when the swap has HAPPENED.** Pressing the
   control posts the message to `registration.waiting` and waits for
   `controllerchange` before reloading. Reloading first would re-enter the same
   old worker and show the same line again — the loop a plain `location.reload()`
   produces once the worker waits properly. A 3-second fallback reload covers a
   worker that never answers, so the control is never dead.
4. **`controllerchange` means two different things and is told apart.** If we
   asked, it is the reader's decision arriving and the page reloads. If we did
   not, something claimed the page unasked — a 1.18.0 worker still in the wild —
   and the honest response is to OFFER, never to reload underneath somebody
   mid-sentence.
5. **A newcomer is never told** (§7h.3). The no-controller gate moved to the TOP
   of `updateIsReady`, above the `waiting` and `installing` checks. It used to sit
   below them, so a first-ever visit that raced a worker into `installed` was told
   its brand-new install was an update.
6. **The button says what it does.** `Reload now` became `Install it now`, and
   the copy now leads with *"it waits until you say so — what you are using now
   keeps working until you install it."* SC 2.5.3 is satisfied by the visible text
   being the accessible name, as it already was.

## The one-release cost, stated because it is invisible

A device running 1.18.0 has 1.18.0's page code, which cannot post `SKIP_WAITING`.
It will see the prompt, and its `Reload now` will not promote the waiting worker;
the update lands when every client of the old worker is gone, which for a
home-screen app means the next full close.

That is one hop, it leaves those devices on a **consistent** 1.18.0 throughout,
and it is the unavoidable price of not being able to patch code that has already
shipped. It is written into the 1.18.1 patch notes in the reader's own words
rather than left to be discovered.

## Consequences

- The reader decides when the app changes underneath them. That is the point.
- The diagnostic gains the state that makes this legible (§7h.4): every cache
  held rather than the first, whether a worker controls the page, and whether one
  is waiting. Two caches is the signature of a half-finished update, and a report
  naming one cache could not show it.
- The report also gains its **address**, which is not §7h but was found by the
  same reading: a report saying `quietkeep-sync-1.18.0` could not settle whether
  it came from production or staging once both served that build, and it cost
  V-15 a round trip on a line that costs nothing.
- **`Devices seen in the log` became `Stores seen in the log`.** A device id is
  minted once per store and kept in IndexedDB (`src/ui/session.ts:83`), and
  IndexedDB is per-origin — so the same iPad has a different one for each edition
  and a fresh one after clearing website data. The old wording read as a count of
  hardware, which it never was, and a reasonable reader reached for the one
  explanation the code rules out.
- `test/update.test.ts` asserts §7h.1 against `public/sw.js` **as text**, with
  comments stripped so that a comment explaining why `skipWaiting` is absent is
  not mistaken for a call to it. The hub's `pwa-check.mjs` owns this rule, but it
  is not run by this repo's CI, and a rule enforced only in another repo's tooling
  is one this repo can silently lose.
- Each of those assertions was proved by planting: putting `skipWaiting()` back
  into `install`, deleting the `message` handler, and leaving the cache name at
  the old release each turn exactly one test red, and only that one.

## The panel budget is now the binding constraint on patch notes, twice running

`tools/smoke.mjs` asserts the ⓘ panel stays under **9,000px**, because a surface
that grows by accumulation eventually becomes the app (Doctrine §4, §7d). The
numbers, recorded because two releases in a row have now been written around
them rather than to the reader:

- 1.18.0 baseline: **8,813px** — 187px of headroom, and its notes were shortened
  during that release to fit.
- 1.18.1 first draft, five notes: **8,985px** — **15px** left. It passed, and
  shipping at fifteen pixels would have handed the next release a red gate for a
  reason that has nothing to do with its change.
- Shortened to three notes for this release, which is the second time the fix has
  been "write less" rather than "make the surface bounded".

**Older releases are NOT the cause and bounding them would not help.** Measured
rather than assumed: the `.note-older` `<details>` holding all 81 earlier
releases is **44px** collapsed. It contributes nothing. Anyone reaching for the
changelog as the obvious culprit — which is the obvious reach — would spend the
afternoon in the wrong file.

**It was measured, and the answer is prose.** With every group expanded at a
390px viewport, the panel is 11,661px and breaks down as:

- **`#group-extras` — 5,695px, very nearly half the panel.** Not notes: roughly
  thirty `<p class="about-p">` and `about-caveat` paragraphs, an `anchor-form`,
  and action rows. Explanatory text that has accumulated a paragraph at a time.
- `#group-data` — 1,871px
- `#group-about` — 1,270px
- `install-steps` — 845px
- `#group-help` — 490px

So the surface to fold is `group-extras`, and the fix §4 asks for is pagination
or progressive disclosure inside it — not shorter changelogs, which is what the
last two releases actually did.

**CORRECTION, 2026-08-04 — the two alarming things above are both overstated,
and measuring properly is what showed it.** Kept rather than rewritten, because
the wrong version was acted on twice.

**First: the panel a reader actually gets is fine.** It opens with every group
FOLDED, and the gate expands them all before measuring. As opened it is:

- 1,796px at any width ≥600px — **1.5 screens** on an iPad, 2.5 on a desktop
- 2,321px at 390px — **2.8 screens** on a phone
- 2,489px at 360px

The 8,551px figure requires a reader to open every group by hand. That is a
worth-having worst case and it is not the reading experience, and the two were
being conflated — including by me, in the paragraph above.

**Second: the gate is NOT measuring the friendliest viewport.** The content
column caps at **600px**, so every width from 600 to 1280 measures identically —
1,796px folded, 8,551px expanded. **That includes the iPad in both orientations**
(820px portrait, 1180px landscape). For the reference platform the gate's number
is exact, and "passing on the widest viewport this app will ever see, on an
iPad-first project" was simply wrong.

**What IS real, and is narrower than claimed:** phones below the 600px cap,
where prose reflows taller — 9,706px at 480px, 11,265px at 390px, 12,288px at
360px, all over the 9,000 budget in the fully-expanded state. Nobody has ever
been shown that state without opening five groups themselves.

**So the panel is not one release from breaking, and the notes did not need
shortening twice.** What is genuinely owed is smaller: an assertion of the
AS-OPENED panel at a phone width, which is the thing a reader meets.

## The real second worker, and the defect it found (1.18.2)

1.18.1 shipped with this section reading *"it does not test the promotion path
with a real second worker"*. `tools/update-walk.mjs` now does, and §7h was right
to insist.

It serves a genuinely different `sw.js` — the real file with a different cache
name — from the walk's own server via a live override, then lets Chromium's own
update machinery run. Nothing is simulated. It asserts the four claims that are
the whole of §7h.1 and .2: the new worker reaches `waiting` and stops there, it
does not become the controller on its own, the reader is told in words they can
see, and the reader's press is what promotes it all the way to a page running
the new build.

**On its first run it failed, and the failure was real.** A brand-new visitor
was being told a new version was ready, thirty seconds into their first-ever
visit — a straight §7h.3 violation, shipped to production in 1.18.1.

**Why every check we had missed it.** §7h.3's gate lives at the top of
`updateIsReady`, and `test/update.test.ts` asserts it there — correctly, and it
passed throughout. But `controllerchange` never calls `updateIsReady`. The
worker's `activate` calls `clients.claim()`, which hands a first-ever visitor
its first controller and fires `controllerchange` exactly like any other swap,
and the handler called `show()`. **The gate was not on the path that needed it.**
A unit test on a decision function cannot see the code path that never asks the
decision function. Fixed by recording whether anything controlled the page at
mount and treating the first claim as what it is.

**And one failure was the instrument, which is worth separating.** The walk's
first attempt waited with a `waitForFunction` whose predicate returned a Promise
— always truthy on the first poll, so the wait returned immediately and the
assertion fired before the worker had installed. It read as a product failure
and was a harness one, and a swallowed `.catch` hid the difference. Polled from
Node instead (LESSONS §24: a failing test can mean the expectation was wrong;
§32: ask what the plant actually moved).

**Both assertions are proved by planting.** Putting `skipWaiting()` back into
`install` fails claims 1 and 2 — the original defect, caught end to end rather
than by reading source. Reverting the newcomer fix fails claim 5. It runs in the
spine as *"A real second worker waits for the reader"*.
