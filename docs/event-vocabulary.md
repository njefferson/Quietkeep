# Event vocabulary

**All application state folds from this list.** Nothing is stored that is not an
event named here. Adding a noun to the app means adding it here first — this
document is the gate, and it exists before any code on purpose.

Related: [ADR-0001](adr/0001-event-sourced-log.md) (the log),
[ADR-0011](adr/0011-no-silent-nodes-gate.md) (the write boundary),
[ADR-0010](adr/0010-decay-primitive.md) (why there is no `overdue` event).

---

## 1 · The record

One record type. `kind` discriminates. There is no second table of "current
state" that could disagree with the log.

```
{
  id:      ULID,              // sortable, collision-safe across devices
  kind:    string,            // from the closed list below
  vault:   VaultId,           // every event belongs to exactly one vault
  node:    NodeId | null,     // the node it concerns, if any
  at:      ISO8601,           // wall clock on the writing device
  device:  DeviceId,
  seq:     integer,           // per-device monotonic; gap-free over OFFERED events (ADR-0027)
  payload: object             // shape is fixed per kind
}
```

**Stamping.** `(at, device, seq)` together. `seq` is per-device monotonic and
gap-free **over offered events**; a gate cure deliberately shares its cause's seq
and a derived id, so a shard proves completeness over offered events while cures
are verifiable by derivation (ADR-0027). `at` is wall clock and therefore
*untrusted for ordering across devices* — a user-facing timestamp, not a clock.
Ties on `(at, device, seq)` break by id, so ordering is total.

**Conflict resolution: per-field last-writer-wins.** Two devices editing
different fields of one node both win. Two devices editing the *same* field
resolve by `at`, tie-broken by `device` string comparison so the result is
deterministic and identical on every device. This is why
[`node.field.set`](#a--node-lifecycle) carries **one** field per event and never
a bag of them — a multi-field event would make field-level LWW impossible.

**Ordering.** The fold sorts by `(at, device, seq)`. A device's own events always
fold in `seq` order regardless of clock skew.

---

## 2 · Node kinds

The `kind` a node *is*, distinct from the event kinds that act on it. Depth is
flexible; the types are fixed.

- **`action`** — Child of an outcome or project. The only thing that appears as a next action.
- **`outcome`** — Any multi-step personal result. *(This is GTD's "project" sense, renamed to avoid colliding with the work-grade `project` below. **Never use the GTD®/Getting Things Done® marks anywhere.**)*
- **`project`** — Work-grade. Optional extended attributes: OPR, stakeholders, suspense list, meeting/decision log, goal link, `role`.
- **`area`** — Ongoing responsibility. Can go dormant; dormancy is a Review exception.
- **`goal`** — Optional OKR-style key results.
- **`waiting-for`** — Owed to you by someone else.
- **`upkeep`** — Carries `interval` + `comfort_window`. The decay primitive's home.
- **`aspiration`** — Menu categories: Read · Try · Go · Make · Research · Save-for. **Cannot carry a clock** (law 6).
- **`bother`** — Free-text worry, pre-triage. Must terminate in a route or a park.
- **`pebble`** — Load, not work. Magnitude `pebble` | `rock` | `boulder`. **Cannot carry a clock** (law 6).
- **`journal`** — Payload always encrypted at rest.
- **`person`** — **Vault-scoped** — the same human in two vaults is two nodes, deliberately.
- **`resume-card`** — Generated, short-lived, spent or expired.
- **`anchor`** — A named recurring delta anchor (e.g. the staff call). Deltas compute between firings.

**Cross-cutting fields**, set via `node.field.set` on any node kind:

- `provenance` — `for/from: self | other(<name>)`
- `inbox_state` — `unclarified` (aggressive same-day clock; carries source tags,
  and a `boss`-tagged run goes one level hotter) or a heat value
- `estimate` — logged from v1, *learned from* in v2
- `note` — free text kept with an item (1.4.0, ADR-0047). Title-class user
  content: plaintext in exports exactly as titles are; renders on the detail
  sheet only; an empty value is the honest "removed". Written by the sheet and
  by the importer; read by `noteOf` in fold.ts — the one reader.
- `situation` — when or where the person means to do the thing, in their own
  words (1.29.0). Title-class user content, exactly like `note`: plaintext in
  exports, empty value is the honest removal, written by the detail sheet, read
  by `situationOf` in fold.ts — the one reader.
  **Why it is a field and not a feature.** Implementation intentions bind a cue
  to an action in advance, so the action fires on noticing the cue rather than
  on self-initiation, which is the step that fails; it is among the very few
  things in this literature with experimental ADHD evidence. The "if" is the
  active ingredient, and a task stored as a noun has only the "then". One field
  does four jobs: the if, an event-based retrieval cue (a datetime is the least
  retrievable anchor there is and was the only one this app had), where a
  routine's chaining lives, and somewhere to put an alternate for when the plan
  breaks.
  **What it must never become.** Self-generated only — the evidence is about
  plans the person wrote. Never required, never validated for form, never
  counted, and never asked whether it worked; a coverage figure for it would be
  a completion percentage wearing a hat. It rides with the item to every surface
  that offers it, verbatim, because a plan shown once and never again is a noun
  in a database.
- `arrangement` — marks an upkeep as something that runs WITHOUT you: a supply
  that reorders itself, a service on a schedule, a renewal (1.21.0, ADR-0074).
  A field and not a kind, for ADR-0042's reason — it decays, completes and
  renders exactly like the upkeep it is. What changes is the question:
  `lastDone` reads as *last confirmed still arranged* rather than *last done*,
  because an arrangement's failure mode is silence and the only useful thing to
  hold is when you last checked it had not stopped. `false` is the honest
  "no longer runs itself"; the field is never removed, so the log keeps the
  decision. Written by `src/ui/arrangement-intents.ts`; read by
  `isArrangement` in `src/arrangement.ts`.
- `arrangement-depends` — the arrangement's continuation depends on somebody
  else, so confirming it means asking them rather than looking (1.21.0).
  Orthogonal to `arrangement`: plenty of arrangements run on a machine you own.
  It changes the words, because "check this" is useless advice when checking is
  not something you can do from here.

## 3 · The closed event list

The **Silent?** column is the machine-checkable form of product law 1: *can this
event leave a node that is not on a surface, under a clock, on the Menu, or
parented to something under a clock?* Every `yes` is a write the boundary must
inspect and either complete or refuse. See [ADR-0011](adr/0011-no-silent-nodes-gate.md).

### A · Node lifecycle

- **`node.created`**
  - Payload: `nodeKind, title, parent?, provenance, arrived?, arrival?`
  - `arrival` says WHICH arrival a node came in on, and it is a wider question
    than `arrived` below. Every node an importer creates carries it — the dated
    rows and the projects that `arrived` deliberately skips included — because
    somebody working through a planner they brought in wants the planner, not
    the part of it the importer could not do anything with. The value is the
    importing commit's own timestamp: an import lands in ONE commit, so every
    event in it already shares an `at`, and that string is both unique per run
    and the date the set is labelled with. Nothing is minted. The built-in
    sample set uses the fixed key `sample` instead, because it did not arrive on
    a day anybody remembers — and naming it is the point: unnamed, it leaves
    loose rows that read as somebody's own forgotten work months later, with no
    way to tell them apart and no way to clean them out.
  - `arrived` marks a row that came in from another planner carrying nothing to
    go on — no date the app kept, no place in this app's vocabulary. It latches
    `captured`, which is what makes something an inbox item, so an import lands
    in the inbox and the offer can hand it over one at a time. Optional and
    additive: every log written before it folds identically without it (law 9).
  - Silent risk: **yes — gated**
- **`node.kind.changed`**
  - Payload: `from, to`
  - Silent risk: **yes — gated** (an `action` demoted to `aspiration` loses its clock)
- **`node.field.set`**
  - Payload: `field, value` — exactly one field
  - Silent risk: no
- **`node.renamed`**
  - Payload: `title`
  - Silent risk: no — renaming removes no coverage
- **`node.parented`**
  - Payload: `parent, priorParent?`
  - Silent risk: **yes — gated** (re-homing under an unclocked parent orphans the node)
- **`node.unparented`**
  - Payload: `priorParent`
  - Silent risk: **yes — gated**
- **`node.trashed`**
  - Payload: `reason?`
  - Silent risk: **yes — gated** — trashing a parent must not orphan its children (ADR-0011)
- **`node.untrashed`**
  - Silent risk: **yes — gated**
- **`node.merged`**
  - Payload: `into`
  - Silent risk: **yes — gated** — merge target must exist and live, or children go silent
  - The UI emitter (1.7.0, ADR-0053) is a BATCH: carried facts first (demand
    clocks the target lacks, the note, people links), the source's live
    children re-homed to the target, then the merge — so folding a duplicate
    never swallows a date, a note, or a child.
- **`node.unmerged`** (1.7.0, ADR-0053)
  - Payload: none
  - Silent risk: **yes** — splitting back out strips the chain coverage the
    target conferred; the gate cures with a same-day clock, like `untrashed`.
  - Carried facts and re-homed children STAY where the merge put them — the
    split restores the node's own standing, not the world before it; the
    words say so.

`node.trashed` is reversible and is *not* an archive: it records "I decided this
is not a thing", which is a decision. Law 3 forbids a bucket for things that
merely *lapsed* — that is a different case entirely, and it is `replan.raised`.

### B · Temporal — the decay primitive

- **`clock.set`**
  - Payload: `clockKind: due | start | suspense | review | park, at, source`
  - Silent risk: no — this is the cure
- **`clock.cleared`**
  - Payload: `clockKind`
  - Silent risk: **yes — gated**
- **`upkeep.interval.set`**
  - Payload: `interval, comfortWindow`
  - Silent risk: no
- **`done.marked`**
  - Payload: `at`
  - Silent risk: **yes — gated** (a completed one-off can orphan its parent)
- **`done.unmarked`**
  - Silent risk: no
- **`anchor.defined`** (emitters 1.17.0, [ADR-0068](adr/0068-the-staff-call.md))
  - Payload: `name, recurrence`
  - Silent risk: no
  - Names a period — "the staff call" — so a report can say *since the last one*
    instead of naming a date. **`anchor` joined `DEMAND_FREE_KINDS` in the same
    release**, which is the price
    [ADR-0057](adr/0057-stakeholders-and-the-decision-log.md) named: before it,
    an anchor node satisfied no clause of law 1, and the gauge that PROVES law 1
    stopped reading zero. A gate change plus a shipped surface, in one release.
  - `recurrence` is kept as typed and **nothing derives from it**. There is no
    scheduler and no next-occurrence; if one is ever wanted it arrives with an
    ADR, not with a parser added quietly (the `affects` rule, ADR-0065).
- **`anchor.fired`**
  - Payload: `anchor, at`
  - Silent risk: no
  - It came round — marked as an ACT, never on a schedule (1.17.0).
  - **`upToSeqByDevice` is the addition that made anchors shippable.** ADR-0057
    deferred them partly because this kind carried no per-device watermark, so a
    cut on it would be the degraded at-only cut `reportedBefore` exists to
    avoid — a shard can deliver work stamped before your last meeting that you
    had never seen. It now carries the same field `status.report.exported` does,
    read by the same `reportedBefore`: one mechanism, two writers. Optional,
    because a firing written before this is still a firing and an old log must
    keep working (law 9).
- **`replan.raised`**
  - Payload: `passedClock, fed[], suspense, daysLeft`
  - Silent risk: no — **and nothing emits it** ([ADR-0034](adr/0034-replan-cards-are-computed.md))
  - **Unemitted BY DESIGN, and it should stay that way.** Replan cards are
    computed from passed clocks at read time ([ADR-0034](adr/0034-replan-cards-are-computed.md));
    a stored one could disagree with the clock it describes.
- **`replan.resolved`**
  - Payload: `choice: compress | escalate | renegotiate | new-date | undate | to-menu`
  - Silent risk: **yes — gated** unless the choice sets a clock or lands on the Menu
- **`park.set`**
  - Payload: `returnAt, reason?`
  - Silent risk: no — a park **always** carries a return clock

> **There is no `overdue` event, and there never will be.** Not in the schema,
> not in a payload, not in a variable name. Pressure is computed from
> `(last_done, comfort_window, now)` and is continuous. A **hard** clock that

> ([ADR-0034](adr/0034-replan-cards-are-computed.md)).

> a defect report.

### C · Capture and triage

- **`capture.recorded`**
  - Payload: `text, source: quick | share-target | url-endpoint | shortcut | focus-interrupt | sample | dump, sourceTags[]`
  - `dump` is one line of a many-line capture committed as a single batch — the
    "Dump session" [ADR-0015](adr/0015-ai-never-blocks.md) already names. Each
    line is its own `capture.recorded` and gets its own same-day cure, so a batch
    is forty ordinary captures rather than one compound thing.
  - `sample` is the demonstration set (`src/sample.ts`), added 2026-07-30. Named
    rather than folded into `quick`, because a capture claiming it came from a
    keystroke when it came from a button labelled "sample work" is a small lie in
    the one place the app keeps its history. Additive only: every log already
    written stays readable.
  - Silent risk: **yes — gated** (an unclarified item gets an aggressive same-day clock at write time, not later)
- **`heat.set`**
  - Payload: `heat: hot | cold`
  - Silent risk: no
- **`clarify.routed`**
  - Payload: `route: do-now | next-action | waiting-for | someday | reference | trash | filed`
  - `filed` is the only route that answers WHERE rather than when: it accompanies
    a `node.parented` and takes its coverage from the parent's clock (law 1(d)).
  - Silent risk: **yes — gated**
- **`clarify.reopened`**
  - Payload: `from: <the route being taken back>`
  - Silent risk: **yes — gated** — undo of a route: the item returns to the inbox
    (`route` → null), and reopening can leave it with no clock, so the gate cures
    it with the same same-day clock a fresh capture gets. Append-only means undo
    is an event, never a deletion; this competes for the same LWW field as
    `clarify.routed`, so undo is safe on a synced log.
- **`do-now.timed`**
  - Payload: `startedAt, endedAt`. `node` is the item.
  - Silent risk: no
  - A SPAN, no verdict (1.10.0, ADR-0059) — the `focus.started` / `focus.ended`
    shape. `outcome: completed | abandoned` was written until 1.10.0 and is
    still present on older events; nothing reads it. It was a record of the
    times you did not finish your own work, which ADR-0042 and ADR-0056 forbid
    in absolute terms. The chosen length is deliberately NOT in the payload, so
    a shortfall cannot be computed by subtraction.
  - **Folds to `n.timedMinutes` as of V2 stage 5** — a LIST, appended, never
    summed and never averaged. `src/duration.ts` reads the two ENDS, because
    task durations are tau-heavy and the mean sits in the gap where almost
    nothing actually lands; folding a total or an average would settle that in
    the store, where no surface could undo it. A span that rounds to zero
    minutes, or that ends before it starts, is dropped — "between 0 minutes and
    4h" says nothing true about either end.
- **`bother.received`**
  - Payload: `text`
  - Silent risk: **yes — gated**
- **`bother.owned`**
  - Payload: `ownership: mine-to-solve | mine-to-track | not-mine-to-carry`
  - Silent risk: **yes — gated**
- **`bother.routed`**
  - Payload: `{route: 'inbox'} | {park: true}` — the real union, one or the
    other, never both
  - Silent risk: no — the flow **cannot** exit without one of these
  - **Corrected 1.17.4:** `events.ts` declared `{route: ClarifyRoute | 'park'}`
    while every emitter wrote `{route:'inbox'}` — not a `ClarifyRoute` at all —
    or `{park:true}` with no `route` key. The declaration moved to reality;
    no emitter changed and the fold reads neither field.
- **`assist.offered`**
  - Payload: `rung: template | workers-ai | byok | manual, suggestions[]`
  - Silent risk: no
  - **Unemitted — reserved for the assist ladder** ([ADR-0015](adr/0015-ai-never-blocks.md)).
    No assisted rung of any kind ships, offline or cloud, so nothing has ever
    had cause to write it.
- **`assist.applied`**
  - Payload: `accepted[], rejected[]`
  - Silent risk: no
  - **Unemitted — reserved with `assist.offered`**, for the same reason.

`not-mine-to-carry` still produces a node — it lands on the Not Now ledger with a
`park.set`. Declining to carry something is recorded, not discarded; that is the
point of the ledger. (Built 1.8.0, ADR-0056 — the first bother build trashed it
instead, and this paragraph was the record of what it should have done.)

### D · Focus and resumption

- **`focus.started`**
  - Payload: `node`
  - Silent risk: no
- **`focus.ended`**
  - Payload: `reason: completed | switched | abandoned | interrupted`
  - Silent risk: no
- **`interrupt.captured`**
  - Payload: `text, duringFocus: NodeId | null`
  - Silent risk: **yes — gated**
- **`resume.card.created`**
  - Payload: `forNode, cue: string | null`
  - Silent risk: no
- **`resume.card.spent`**
  - Silent risk: no
- **`resume.card.expired`**
  - Payload: `toReviewQuestion: bool`
  - Silent risk: no

The five-word *"I was about to…"* cue is `cue`, and it is **skippable** — `null`
is a valid, unremarkable value, never nagged about.

### E · Work domain

- **`waiting.opened`**
  - Payload: `person, forWhat, since`
  - Silent risk: no
- **`waiting.closed`**
  - Payload: `outcome`
  - Silent risk: **yes — gated**
- **`dependency.declared`**
  - Payload: `feeds: NodeId, leadEstimateDays?, suspense?`
  - Silent risk: no — **gated**: must name a live target and must not close a loop (build-plan 27)
  - **Corrected 1.17.4:** both trailing fields are optional now, and `suspense`
    is dead. It was required, folded by NOTHING (suspense clocks come solely
    from `suspense.set`), and the sheet's builder filled it with its own stamp
    time — a meaningless value — only because the type demanded one. The
    merge-carried edge omits `leadEstimateDays` when the source has none, so
    requiring that made every carried edge fail the type too. Nothing writes
    `suspense` any more; it stays declared optional so the type still
    describes the recorded population instead of disowning old logs.
- **`dependency.released`**
  - Payload: `feeds`
  - Silent risk: **yes — gated**
- **`node.released` / `node.reclaimed`** (1.32.0)
  - Payload: `at: ISODateTime` / none
  - Silent risk: **yes — gated**, both, and for different reasons. Putting a
    thing down EXEMPTS it, so it cannot silence itself — but it can silence its
    CHILDREN, because a put-down ancestor confers no coverage, exactly as a
    trashed one confers none. Picking one back up removes the exemption and needs
    a clock of its own.
  - **The exit that is neither done nor deleted.** Law 1 guarantees nothing goes
    quiet, which means everything held comes back for ever until it is finished
    or binned. For work that mattered and no longer does, both are wrong:
    `done.marked` is a lie written into an append-only log, and `node.trashed`
    reads as destroying something you cared about, which is what people will not
    do. So they carry it — and the one reset left is deleting the app and
    reinstalling, destroying everything to avoid looking at some of it.
  - **No browsable collection, no count, no required reason.** `heldNodes`
    excludes these, which removes them from every surface, range and gauge at
    once. `releasedNodes` exists so the complement is visible in code and so
    search can reach a named one; **nothing renders it as a list**. A place to
    look at everything you put down is another pile, and the regret it collects
    is what made discarding expensive in the first place.
  - **Reversible, and findable by name.** `searchReleased` answers a query you
    typed about a thing you remembered, and never volunteers. That reversibility
    is what makes putting a thing down cheap enough to do, which is the whole
    mechanism — an exit people will not use is not an exit.
  - Not carried by a merge: putting a thing down is a decision about THAT thing,
    and writing it onto a survivor would take a live thing out of your hands
    because something else folded into it.
- **`after.set`** (1.30.0)
  - Payload: `after: NodeId`
  - Silent risk: **yes — gated**
  - **The other kind of anchor, and the only one in the app that is not a
    clock.** It says *this does not begin until that is finished*. Setting one
    mints no date and creates no demand.
  - **Not `dependency.declared` wearing a different hat.** A dependency says
    *this feeds that*, lives on the upstream node pointing forward, and exists to
    do date arithmetic — it answers "if I do not do this, what breaks, and when
    must I start?". Feeding something does not mean the other thing cannot be
    worked on in parallel. An `after` lives on the DEPENDENT pointing back, which
    is the direction the readiness question is asked in, and does no arithmetic
    at all.
  - **Single-valued.** "What is this waiting for" with two answers is a join
    rather than a chain, and a join is where a chain quietly stops moving. Its
    own LWW key `after`, so setting on one device and clearing on another
    converge on whichever happened later rather than on arrival order.
  - **Gated hard, because it confers law 1 coverage.** The antecedent must exist,
    be alive, be unfinished, be a kind that can be finished — no demand-free
    kind, which is never completed — must not be the node itself, and must close
    no loop. Every one of those is a way the promise clause (e) makes could be
    false at the moment it was written, and coverage that is false on arrival is
    the defect stage 1 removed.
  - **Carried by a merge in both directions.** The survivor takes the source's
    antecedent into a silence, and everything that waited on the source is
    re-pointed at the survivor. Without the reverse carry, folding one step of a
    routine would make every later step silent and cure it into a dateless card
    — an act meant to preserve work destroying the structure that says what order
    it goes in.
- **`after.cleared`** (1.30.0)
  - Payload: none
  - Silent risk: **yes — gated**. Cutting the anchor withdraws clause (e), and
    the cure is the same-day clock a lost parent gets: the thing is waiting for
    nothing now, so it goes back to being asked about.
- **`suspense.set`**
  - Payload: `at, label?`
  - Silent risk: no
- **`project.role.set`**
  - Payload: `role: execute | track`
  - Silent risk: **yes — gated** (a `track` project emits no next actions — only Waiting-Fors and Upkeep check-ins, so its children must re-home)
- **`opr.assigned`**
  - Payload: `person`
  - Silent risk: no
- **`stakeholder.added` / `.removed`** (emitters + folds 1.9.0, ADR-0057)
  - Payload: `person`
  - Silent risk: no
  - Both fold into `n.people[]` — the ONE home. `added` appends the
    `stakeholder` link idempotently, byte-identically to
    `person.linked{relation:'stakeholder'}`, so a link written any time since
    0.15.0 already reads without anything being re-entered.
  - `removed` is the ONLY event in this vocabulary that subtracts a person
    link, and it is scoped to person AND relation: taking somebody off the
    list must never strip the same person's `opr` or `waiting-on`. A removal
    naming nobody is a no-op, never a remove-all.
- **`decision.logged`** (emitter + fold 1.9.0, ADR-0057)
  - Payload: `text, at, meeting?`
  - Silent risk: no
  - Folds into `n.decisions[]` — APPEND-ONLY and idempotent by event id. No
    LWW stamp: a log is not a slot, and two devices logging different
    decisions must end with both. Never edited, never removed; the way back
    is to log the new decision.
  - `meeting` is folded and rendered when present, and written by nothing in
    1.9.0 — nothing resolves a meeting name yet, and the field is reserved
    additively (law 9).
- **`delta.recorded`**
  - Payload: `sinceAnchor | sinceExport, text`
  - Silent risk: no
  - **Unemitted, deferred with anchors.** The status report ships and records
    itself as `status.report.exported`; this kind is the anchor-scoped delta,
    which waits on the watermark this repo does not have.
  - **Corrected 1.17.4:** the watermark clause is stale — the repo HAS the
    per-device watermark since 1.17.0 (`anchor.fired.upToSeqByDevice`, read by
    `reportedBefore`). The kind stays unemitted for a simpler reason: the
    anchor-cut delta shipped without it. A report cut at an anchor is still
    recorded as `status.report.exported`, and the cut itself is derived from
    `anchor.fired` — there is nothing left for this noun to say. Reserved
    additively (law 9).
- **`status.report.exported`**
  - Payload: `format: clipboard | markdown | print | csv, scope, upToSeqByDevice?`
  - Silent risk: no — this is the provenance "delta since last export" reads from
  - **`upToSeqByDevice` was written and read for four releases without being
    declared** — here or in `events.ts` (corrected 1.17.0). `src/ui/about.ts`
    has put it in this payload since the watermark landed and `src/fold.ts`
    folds it into `State.lastReportMark`, which is what makes the next delta a
    question about what was REPORTED rather than about the clock. Nothing
    misbehaved; the record simply omitted a field the delta cut depends on, in
    the one path an audit had already rescued from time-only cuts. Found while
    giving `anchor.fired` the same field.
- **`request.declined`** (emitters 1.8.0, ADR-0056)
  - Payload: `person (NodeId | null), what, reason?`
  - Silent risk: **yes — gated** → Not Now ledger + park. The write paths carry
    their own park in the same batch (to the request slot when one is set, else
    end of today); the gate's cure is the backstop for a bare event from an
    import or an older shard.
  - `person` is null when nobody has said who — the `waitingOn` precedent: an
    ordinary state, not a defect (the bother flow never asks). `what` is the
    title SNAPSHOT at decline time, so the record survives a rename (the
    consent-sentence rule). `reason` is a fixed provenance string
    (`detail` | `bother`), never free text.
  - Folds to `n.notNow {person, what, at}` under its own LWW key; cleared by
    `clock.cleared{park}` (carrying it after all) and `done.marked`.
- **`timer.length.set`** (emitter 1.10.0, ADR-0059)
  - Payload: `minutes` — a whole number from the closed offer (2, 5, 10, 20, 30). `node: null`.
  - Silent risk: no
  - Folds to `State.timerMinutes` (state-level LWW, the `requestSlot` shape). A
    length outside the offer reads as the two-minute default — refused at read
    time, never guessed, because a length nobody was offered is a commitment
    nobody made.
- **`day.boundary.set`** (emitter V2 stage 5)
  - Payload: `hour` — a whole number, 0–11, local. `node: null`.
  - Silent risk: no
  - **Emitted from Extras**, beside the timer length and set the same way:
    calmly, and never at the moment it would matter. The offered list stops at
    6am; the fold accepts to 11.
  - Folds to `State.dayBoundaryHour` (state-level LWW, the `timerMinutes`
    shape). An hour outside 0–11 is refused at the fold and reads as null —
    never clamped, because clamping would have the app invent a boundary and
    then run every "today" in the product off it.
  - Null reads as midnight, which is what every clock did before this existed,
    so an unset boundary changes no existing answer. It is STATED and never
    observed: nothing watches when the last event of a day was written and
    proposes an hour from it, on the rule that already governs weight and
    capacity. It moves where the day's edge falls and adds no time-of-day to
    any clock — clocks stay day-granular (ADR-0010).
- **`request.slot.set`** (emitter 1.8.0, ADR-0056)
  - Payload: `recurrence` — `weekly:mon` … `weekly:sun`; `''` clears. `node: null`.
  - Silent risk: no
  - Folds to `State.requestSlot` (state-level LWW, the `focus` shape). An
    unrecognised recurrence reads as no slot — refused at read time, never
    guessed. Null slot = the feature is invisible; setting a day IS the opt-in.
- **`comms.sweep.scheduled`**
  - Payload: `at`
  - Silent risk: no
  - **Unemitted, and superseded in practice.** The comms sweep ships
    ([ADR-0042](adr/0042-the-comms-sweep.md)) as a FIELD on an upkeep node
    (`COMMS_FIELD` in `src/comms.ts`) rather than as its own kind, because it
    decays, completes and renders exactly like an upkeep and inventing a kind
    would mean teaching every projection about a thing they already know. These
    two nouns are what that design replaced.
- **`comms.sweep.ran`**
  - Payload: `at`
  - Silent risk: no
  - **Unemitted, superseded with `comms.sweep.scheduled`** — a sweep being done
    is a `done.marked` on the upkeep, like every other completion.

### F · Load and capacity

- **`pebble.raised`**
  - Payload: `magnitude, affects: NodeId[]`
  - Silent risk: no — pebbles are demand-free by construction (law 6)
  - **Emitted since 1.15.0** ([ADR-0065](adr/0065-load-not-work.md)), from the
    load entry under capture. The design was settled in
    [ADR-0014](adr/0014-demand-free-types.md) from the start — a pebble links to
    the nodes it affects and **"may depress capacity / WIP while active"** — and
    the consumer is `src/load.ts`: active weight narrows the OFFER and nothing
    else, never the gauge, never the todo list, never below one thing.
  - `affects` is a plain list for a person to read. **Nothing derives from it**,
    deliberately: co-occurrence only, never causation (law 7).
- **`pebble.settled`**
  - Silent risk: no
  - **Emitted since 1.15.0.** The weight comes off; the node stays, exactly as
    a completed thing stays. Nothing here deletes what happened.
- **`capacity.declared`**
  - Payload: `level: low | steady | sharp | unsure`
  - Silent risk: no
  - **Emitted since 1.15.0**, from the load entry, and read by `src/load.ts`.
    Four words and no number: a level you can say out loud is a description,
    where a number would be a score about yourself (law 5). An unrecognised
    level is REFUSED at the fold rather than guessed — the app has no opinion
    about your capacity except the one you handed it.
- **`wip.limit.set`**
  - Payload: `limit`
  - Silent risk: no
  - **Unemitted.** `capacity.declared` turned out to be the whole of what 1.15.0
    needed: it is your own word about how things are, where a WIP limit is a
    number you set about yourself, which is nearer a target than a description.
    Its intended consumer is the cap on **Composed Today** — a limit you place on
    your own choosing — and that waits on the module rather than on a decision.
- **`estimate.recorded`**
  - Payload: `durationMinutes, basis: guess | prior`
  - Silent risk: no
  - **Folds to `n.estimateMinutes` as of V2 stage 5**, under per-node LWW. It
    shipped in v1 and stayed unfolded for eleven releases on purpose — "the
    feature can be late; the data cannot be backfilled" — and this is the
    projection that finally consumes it. A non-positive or non-finite value is
    REFUSED rather than stored, on the timer-length rule.
  - It is the person's own word about how long something will take, and it is
    never scored against what happened. `do-now.timed` records what did happen;
    nothing in the app draws a line between the two, because "you said twenty
    minutes and it took ninety" is an indictment dressed as data.

### G · Structure and store

- **`vault.created`**
  - Payload: `name, domain: work | personal | journal`
  - Silent risk: no
  - **Unemitted.** Vaults were closed as a mechanism by Q-10 and the journal
    took the kind-plus-encryption route instead
    ([ADR-0061](adr/0061-the-journal-is-a-kind-not-a-vault.md)). The `vault`
    field stays on every event and the gate's cross-vault refusal stays
    enforced — both cost nothing and removing either would be a destructive
    schema change — but nothing creates a second vault.
- **`vault.locked` / `.unlocked`**
  - Payload: `method: passphrase`
  - Silent risk: no
  - **Unemitted, and superseded** (1.13.0, [ADR-0061](adr/0061-the-journal-is-a-kind-not-a-vault.md)).
    They belonged to the vault split, which ADR-0061 replaced with
    `kind: 'journal'` plus an encrypted payload. They stay in the vocabulary
    because the log is append-only and removing a name is a destructive schema
    change for no gain — but nothing writes them, and an unlock is a session
    fact rather than a durable one, so nothing should.
- **`device.registered`**
  - Payload: `device, label`
  - Silent risk: no
  - **Unemitted, and redundant.** `State.devices` is folded from the `device`
    field every event already carries, so a device is known by having written
    something. There is no surface that lists devices and nothing that needs a
    label.
- **`situation.saved`**
  - Payload: `name, context, minutes` — either of the last two may be null
  - Silent risk: no — it touches no node, so it can take no coverage away
  - Folds to `State.situations`, a state-level map like `modules`. Saving under
    an existing name replaces it: one name, one situation.
  - **An event and not a device preference**, unlike `where.now` and
    `how.long`. Those are preferences because where you are is not a fact about
    your work and a stored trail of it is what law 7 keeps the app out of. A
    situation you NAMED is something you recognise about how you work — nearer
    a context or a role — and it should survive a new device.
- **`situation.forgotten`**
  - Payload: `name`
  - Silent risk: no
  - Scoped to one name, never a clear-all; naming nobody is a no-op.
- **`module.enabled` / `.disabled`**
  - Payload: `module`
  - Silent risk: no
  - Folds into `State.modules` as of 1.6.0 (a set; enabled adds, disabled
    removes — order-dependent like `dependency.released`, covered by the same
    discipline). First customer: `today` (Composed Today, ADR-0051); second is
    `clock` (the header clock, ADR-0075). Both are opt-in chrome, and neither
    needed a noun of its own — which is the point of this kind existing.
- **`consent.granted`**
  - Payload: `scope, whatLeaves: string, rung`
  - Silent risk: no
  - **Unemitted — reserved, and the reservation is load-bearing.**
    [ADR-0015](adr/0015-ai-never-blocks.md) binds every cloud rung to a recorded
    consent sentence naming exactly what leaves the device. No such rung ships,
    so nothing triggers it. **Sync is the open question**: it sends ciphertext to
    a relay that cannot read it, and [ADR-0037](adr/0037-sync-design.md) never
    mentions consent — which is a question nobody has asked in writing rather
    than a settled answer.
- **`consent.revoked`**
  - Payload: `scope`
  - Silent risk: no
  - **Unemitted — reserved with `consent.granted`.**
- **`snapshot.written`**
  - Payload: `upToSeq, reason: periodic | pre-migration`
  - Silent risk: no
  - **Emitted since 1.14.1** with `reason: 'periodic'`, once per boot when the
    log has run more than `SNAPSHOT_LAG_LIMIT` events past the newest snapshot
    ([ADR-0063](adr/0063-startup-does-not-replay-the-world.md)). It was declared
    in Phase 0 and written by nothing until then, which is why every cold start
    folded the entire log. `reason: 'pre-migration'` is never written — there is
    no migration path yet, and the record should not claim one.
- **`schema.migrated`**
  - Payload: `from, to`
  - Silent risk: no
  - **Unemitted, and no migration machinery exists** — no schema version, no
    migration path, no pre-migration export, though the Dexie schema has already
    moved v1 to v2. That move was additive (a table and an index), which Dexie
    performs without touching a stored value, so nothing has ever been
    transformed and law 9 has never had an occasion to bind.
  - **The claim in the words is gone.** This kind used to render as "a copy was
    exported first" — law 9's promise attached to an event that records
    something else, unreachable behind an unemitted noun and still a claim
    (Doctrine §5). It now says only that the format moved; the copy has its own
    nouns, `snapshot.written` and `export.written`, which record something that
    happened rather than assuring it alongside something else.
  - **Enforced forward** by `test/migration-guard.test.ts`: a Dexie `.upgrade()`
    is the only place data is transformed, so declaring one without the export
    wired fails. The guard passes trivially today, deliberately — it is aimed at
    the edit that will first need it, and it names what to build when it fires.
- **`export.written`**
  - Payload: `at, scope, encrypted: bool`
  - Silent risk: no
  - **Read since 1.14.0** by `src/copies.ts` — the ⓘ panel's "Last copy" row and
    the sentence about work no copy holds ([ADR-0062](adr/0062-the-copy-and-the-way-back.md)).
    It had been written since Phase 0 and read by nothing.
  - **`scope` decides whether it is a copy at all**, and this is load-bearing.
    The same noun records a whole importable export (`all`, `before-letting-go`),
    a range *reading* copy that `inspectExport` refuses, and the calendar `.ics`.
    Only the first family counts as your data being saved; the whole-copy scopes
    are `WHOLE_COPY_SCOPES` in `src/copies.ts` and `deliverCopy` refuses any
    scope outside them, so the set cannot fall behind the writers.
- **`shard.folded`**
  - Payload: `fromDevice, taken, skipped, at`
  - Silent risk: no — another device's copy was folded in ([ADR-0035](adr/0035-multi-device-shard-union.md))
- **`import.seeded`**
  - Payload: `fromExport, at`
  - Silent risk: no
- **`terminology.skin.applied`**
  - Payload: `skin, vault`
  - Silent risk: no
  - **Unemitted — reserved.** No terminology skinning is built, and none is
    scheduled; the app has one vocabulary and it is the one in this document.
- **`template.loaded`**
  - Payload: `template, source, licence`
  - Silent risk: no
  - **Unemitted — reserved for the offline template library**, which is the
    bottom rung of ADR-0015's ladder and unbuilt like the rest of it.
- **`shard.compacted`**
  - Payload: `device, throughSeq, archivedTo`
  - Silent risk: no
  - **Unemitted, and the machinery does not exist.** [ADR-0001](adr/0001-event-sourced-log.md)'s
    fifth consequence is "the log grows forever, compaction is required", and
    [ADR-0003](adr/0003-folder-mirror.md) even specifies the trigger. Neither is
    built. It was refused in 1.14.1 deliberately: discarding history under a law
    that says data is never lost deserves a measurement first
    ([ADR-0063](adr/0063-startup-does-not-replay-the-world.md)).

**`consent.granted.whatLeaves` is a required human-readable string**, not a flag.
It is the literal sentence shown to the user, stored so the record of what they
agreed to survives a copy change (law 10).

**`import.seeded` never merges.** It starts a fresh store. There is no
`import.merged` event and adding one would break law 9.

### H · People and journal

- **`person.created`**
  - Payload: `name` — vault-scoped
  - Silent risk: no
- **`person.linked`**
  - Payload: `node, person, relation: opr | stakeholder | waiting-on | requested-by | mentioned | promised-to | rest-with-them | rest-with-me`
  - The last two (3.20.0, ADR-0122) are the DIRECTORY — a pointer that a named
    person holds the rest of something, or that the reader does. A pair rather
    than one noun because a relation that could only say *they hold more than
    you* would encode a deficit into the vocabulary; the pointer carries no
    text, no version and no age, which is the whole reason it survives the
    research catalogue's entry 32.
- **`promise.released`**
  - Payload: `person`
  - Silent risk: no — a person link carries no coverage, so taking one off
    removes none; the node was your own work before and after.
  - **The second subtraction in the vocabulary**, and ADR-0057 calls
    `stakeholder.removed` the only one. Deliberate: that event filtering on
    `relation: 'promised-to'` would write a false sentence into an append-only
    log. ADR-0057's rule is that a subtraction must be SCOPED, and this is —
    one person, one relation, named in the noun.
  - Load-bearing rather than tidy: a promise nobody can take back is a permanent
    claim that you owe somebody something, which is the ledger `src/requests.ts`
    says this app exists not to keep.
  - Silent risk: no
- **`holding.released`** (3.20.0, ADR-0122)
  - Payload: `person, relation: rest-with-them | rest-with-me`
  - Silent risk: no — a person link carries no coverage, so taking one off
    removes none.
  - **The third subtraction**, scoped like the other two: one person, one
    relation. The relation rides in the payload rather than in the noun — the
    holding axis has two directions and one act of release, and two nouns would
    be two spellings of one act. The payload may name ONLY those two: any other
    relation is the false sentence the `stakeholder.removed{relation}` shortcut
    was refused over, and the fold treats it as a no-op, never a remove-all.
  - Load-bearing for `promise.released`'s reason, pointed at somebody else: a
    directory pointer nobody can take back goes on asserting who holds the rest
    of a thing after it has stopped being true, and a directory that cannot be
    corrected is worse than no directory. Q-15's reversibility condition,
    discharged.
- **`context.created`** (emitter 2.2.0, ADR-0092)
  - Payload: `name` — vault-scoped
  - Silent risk: no
  - A context is WHERE work can be done — at home, at work, out, on the phone.
    It is a node so it can be renamed and so nothing has to parse a string, and
    it is **demand-free**: the gate refuses a clock on it, and it can never be
    offered as work.
- **`context.attached`** (emitter 2.2.0, ADR-0092)
  - Payload: `node, context`
  - Silent risk: no
  - **A LABEL, NEVER A PARENT.** A thing lives in exactly one place in this
    tree; it can be doable in several. Q-13 settled that anything crossing
    containers has to be a cross-cutting link rather than a container, and this
    is that shape. **Law 1 does not read it** — attaching a context can never
    make a silent node non-silent, and the write gate is unchanged by it.
- **`context.detached`** (emitter 2.2.0, ADR-0092)
  - Payload: `node, context`
  - Silent risk: no
  - Subtracts one link. Scoped to the node AND the context, so taking a thing
    off "At work" leaves "At home" alone.
- **`role.created`** (emitter 2.6.0, ADR-0096)
  - Payload: `name` — vault-scoped
  - Silent risk: no
  - A role is WHO work is for — an identity that crosses multiple areas, which
    is the owner's own framing recorded in NOTES Q-13. It is a node so it can be
    renamed and so nothing has to parse a string, and it is **demand-free**: the
    gate refuses a clock on it and it can never be offered as work.
- **`role.attached`** (emitter 2.6.0, ADR-0096)
  - Payload: `node, role`
  - Silent risk: no
  - **A LABEL, NEVER A PARENT**, and this is the case Q-13 was actually about: a
    role crosses areas, this tree is single-parent, so a role structurally
    cannot be a container. An area HOLDS work; a role runs THROUGH areas.
    **Law 1 does not read it** — attaching a role can never make a silent node
    non-silent, and the write gate is unchanged by it.
- **`role.detached`** (emitter 2.6.0, ADR-0096)
  - Payload: `node, role`
  - Silent risk: no
  - Subtracts one link. Scoped to the node AND the role, so taking a thing out
    of one identity leaves the others alone.
- **`journal.entry.written`** (emitter 1.13.0, ADR-0061)
  - Payload: `v, iv, ct` — the `seal.ts` envelope. **Always encrypted.** The
    third field was called `ciphertext` here from the first draft; nothing ever
    emitted the noun, so it now takes the name the code already uses rather than
    a translation layer between two names for one thing.
  - Silent risk: no
  - **The fold never reads this.** It has no key, and it must stay a pure
    function of the event set whether the journal is unlocked or not. The
    journal surface reads the log directly and opens entries in the UI — the
    log-viewer pattern — which is also why search cannot index the journal:
    there is nothing in state to index.
- **`journal.sealed`** (emitter 1.13.0, ADR-0061)
  - Payload: `salt, iterations`. `node: null`. Written ONCE, when the passphrase
    is first set.
  - Silent risk: no
  - The salt is not a secret and is in the log in the clear on purpose: it must
    reach a second device, because the whole point is that the same passphrase
    opens the journal there too. The iteration count travels with it so a later
    release can raise the work factor and still open what an earlier one sealed.
- **`journal.tag.attached`**
  - Payload: `tag`
  - Silent risk: no

> `journal.tag.attached` exists for **co-occurrence rendering only**. There is no
> sentiment field, no valence, no score, and no event that could carry one
> (law 7). The app plots; the human interprets. **Still unemitted after 1.13.0**:
> tags are their own decision about what may be rendered from them, and the
> journal shipped without needing them.

### I · Menu and re-entry

- **`menu.item.added`**
  - Payload: `category: read | try | go | make | research | save-for`
  - Silent risk: no — the Menu **is** a surface (law 1, clause c)
- **`menu.item.removed`**
  - Payload: `from: <the category it left>`
  - Silent risk: **yes — gated** — taking an item **off** the Menu removes law 1's
    clause (c), so the gate cures it with a same-day clock. It is the reverse of
    `menu.item.added` (used to undo a someday/reference route), and NOT
    `menu.item.promoted`: removing a wish from the list is not the deliberate act
    of deciding to do it, so the kind is untouched.
- **`menu.item.promoted`**
  - Payload: `toKind`
  - Silent risk: **yes — gated** — a deliberate promotion, never an accrued obligation
- **`save-for.updated`**
  - Payload: `target, saved` — both manual
  - Silent risk: no
- **`lapse.migration.ran`**
  - Payload: `absenceDays, itemsTriaged`
  - Silent risk: no
- **`reentry.greeted`**
  - Payload: `absenceDays, shown: {nextUp: boolean, triage: count ≤3, gauge: boolean}`
  - Silent risk: no
  - **Corrected 1.17.4:** `events.ts` declared `shown` as `{nextUp:
    NodeId|null, triage: NodeId[], gauge: number}` — node ids in a greeting —
    while the only emitter has always written WHETHER each part was shown and
    how many triage items, never which nodes. The declaration moved to the
    emitter's privacy-better shape.
- **`amnesty.offered` / `.accepted`**
  - Payload: `scope`
  - Silent risk: no

> **Naming collision, resolved deliberately.** The brief's user-facing vocabulary
> calls the lapse ritual *"Migration"*, which collides with schema migration. The
> user-facing word stays **Migration**; the events are `lapse.migration.ran` and
> `schema.migrated`. Never `migration.*` bare — it is ambiguous and the ambiguity
> is in the most data-critical part of the system.

The re-entry greeting is **bounded by schema**: `reentry.greeted.shown` has room
for exactly Next-up, at most three triage items, and the gauge. There is no
shape it could take that shows the backlog (law 8).

### K · Composed today (1.6.0, ADR-0051)

- **`today.chosen` / `today.released`**
  - Payload: `day` — the LOCAL day key the choice is for/from
  - Silent risk: no — a choice adds no coverage and removes none
  - Folds to one LWW slot per node (`todayFor`). Read ONLY through
    `composedFor`, which answers for the current day — the expiry IS the
    projection: no exported reader takes a day argument, so "chosen yesterday
    and not done" is structurally uncomputable (laws 3 and 5). The whole
    capability is an opt-in module (`today`), off by default.

### J · Wholesale acts (1.5.0)

- **`range.acted`**
  - Payload: `scope, verb, count` — `scope` is the LITERAL sentence the user
    saw and agreed to (the consent-sentence rule: a key cannot reproduce what
    was agreed to once the copy changes); `verb` the machine name
    (`put-under | to-menu | park | let-go | bring-back | undo`); `count` the
    number of items in THIS chunk. `node` is null.
  - Silent risk: no — the ordinary events that follow it in the same chunk
    carry their own risk and their own cures.
  - Written FIRST in each chunk of a bulk act, so the log explains the pile of
    ordinary events after it. Deliberately unfolded: the state change is
    carried entirely by those events, and folding the receipt would count the
    act twice. The log viewer and per-node history read it from the log.

---

## 4 · What the fold produces

```
state = fold(snapshot, events after snapshot.upToSeq)
```

Startup replays the tail only — never the world (the < 2 s cold-capture budget
depends on it). Derived values are **computed, never stored**, so they cannot
drift out of agreement with the log:

- **pressure** — from `(last_done, comfort_window, now)`, continuous, unbounded
  above, no thresholds baked into storage
- **coverage gauge** — a count of nodes failing law 1's four-way test. **The
  invariant is enforced at write time, so the honest value is always 0**; the
  gauge exists to *prove* it, and a non-zero reading is a bug in the write gate,
  not a state for the user to fix
- **latest-start / buffer burn** — from `dependency.declared` + `suspense.set`
- **Next-up** — hard landscape > resume cards > pressure rank
- **Review exceptions** — stalled (no next action), orphan (no parent), dormant
  (area with no active work or a stale clock), unsupported goal
- **delta** — the diff between two `anchor.fired` or `status.report.exported` points

---

## 5 · Rules for changing this list

1. **The list is closed.** A writer emitting an unlisted `kind` is rejected, not
   ignored — silent tolerance is how a schema rots.
2. **Additive only.** Events are never renamed, never removed, never have a field
   change meaning. Old logs must fold on new code, forever (law 9).
3. **Superseding, not editing.** A replaced event kind stays in this document
   with a `Superseded by` line. Readers of a five-year-old log need it.
