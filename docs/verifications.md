# Verifications

The standing answer to *"did we ever actually check that?"*

Doctrine §6: a claim without evidence is a guess, and it gets labelled as one.
**VERIFIED** and **NEEDS THE OWNER'S HANDS** are kept apart on purpose. A row does not
move to VERIFIED because it seems likely — only because something proved it, and
the proof is named in the row.

Rows are never deleted. When one is resolved, the old status stays visible with
a dated resolution beneath it.

**Status vocabulary**

- **`VERIFIED`** — Checked, with the evidence named. Safe to build on.
- **`PARTIAL`** — Part of the question is settled; the rest is not. The unsettled part is stated.
- **`UNVERIFIED`** — Not checked, or checked by a method too weak to count. **Not** the same as "probably fine".
- **`INCONCLUSIVE`** — A check was attempted and returned nothing usable. The attempt is recorded so it isn't repeated blindly.
- **`NEEDS THE OWNER'S HANDS`** — Cannot be checked from a session by any means. Requires real hardware or a real account.
- **`NOT RUN`** — Deliberately deferred, with the reason and the trigger for running it.
- **`WITHDRAWN`** — No longer relevant — scope changed. The row stays so the consideration is on record.
- **`WORKING`** — An observed behaviour is now correct; recorded when the cause is understood well enough to name but the row is about a fixed symptom, not a standing invariant.
- **`PROVEN`** — A one-off fact was demonstrated (e.g. a network limit), with the demonstration named.

A row may carry a compound status line (e.g. `STEP 1 ANSWERED · step 2 pending`)
where a single word would hide which half is done. When it does, the halves are
named explicitly rather than averaged into one label.

## V-00 · iPadOS storage behaviour — **the reference platform**
**Status: STEP 1 ANSWERED on device, 2026-07-28** · step 2 waits for tomorrow

### Measured on a real iPad, from the deployed app

- **Storage API** — available
- ****Persistent right now**** — **yes**
- **First granted** — just now (2026-07-28, 12:13)
- **Quota** — **39,322 MB** (~38 GB)
- **Used** — 0.4 MB
- **Notifications** — granted
- **Events held** — 2

**`persist()` returned true**, with notification permission granted first — which is the
sequence the brief claimed was required. This does not prove the requirement (nobody tried
it *without* notifications), only that the documented path works.

**And the promise held on real hardware.** The owner force-quit the app and reopened it; the
captured item was still there. That is the app's one claim, tested the only way that counts.

**Two things worth reading off this that were not the question:**

- **38 GB of quota.** Eviction pressure is not a near-term concern on this device, which
  changes how urgent the export path is — it is still the durability story
  ([ADR-0004](adr/0004-ios-path.md)), but it is not holding back a cliff.
- **2 events for 1 node.** That is `capture.recorded` plus the gate's cure — the same-day
  clock written in the same transaction (ADR-0008/0011). **Law 1 is being enforced on the
  device**, not just in Node, and the gauge reading `0 silent` is a real measurement.

### Still open — step 2, and it is the one that matters
**Does `persisted()` still report `true` the next morning?** A `true` on day one that
silently reverts is worse than a `false`, because the app would be promising durability it
does not have. The panel records the first-grant timestamp, so opening it again tomorrow
answers this by inspection. **Until that reads yes, this row is not VERIFIED.**

Step 3 (two Home Screen icons for the same origin — one store or two?) is untested and
lower value now that persistence is granted.

**And a companion row, raised 2026-08-02: [V-20](#v-20--does-clearing-the-browsers-website-data-take-a-home-screen-apps-store--needs-noahs-hands).**
Persistence covers eviction, never a person clearing their own website data — so
this row's `yes` and that row's answer are about two different threats, and only
one of them has been measured.

---

## V-00a · The original framing
**Status: superseded by the readings above** · requires a real device

> **Promoted 2026-07-27.** This was V-07, filed as a nice-to-know whose failure "costs
> nothing". That is no longer true. The owner's decision that this is a **personal-iPad app**
> makes iPadOS the *only* platform in scope, so these two behaviours now govern the
> single environment the app is built for. The original row is preserved below as V-07;
> this is the one that matters.

Two claims from the brief, both needing confirmation on the current iOS/iPadOS release:

1. IndexedDB is isolated **per home-screen icon** — two icons for the same origin do
   not share a store.
2. Storage persistence still requires **notification permission** to have been granted.

> **2026-07-28 — this is no longer blocked.** It was unanswerable because there was
> nothing to put on an iPad. There is now: the shell ships a **Storage panel** that
> reads `persist()`, `persisted()` and `estimate()` and records the first grant with
> its timestamp, so step 2 answers itself by opening the panel again the next day.
> the owner runs it at **staging.quietkeep.pages.dev** once Phase 1 is deployed.

**What to check, in order:**
1. Install to the Home Screen from Safari. Does `navigator.storage.persist()` resolve
   `true` after notification permission is granted? — *the panel's "Ask for persistent
   storage" button does exactly this, requesting notification permission first.*
2. Does `navigator.storage.persisted()` **still** report `true` the next morning?
   — *open the panel again; it shows both the current value and when it was first
   granted, so a silent revert is visible rather than inferred.*
3. If two icons are created for the same origin, do they see the same data?
   — *add a second Home Screen icon, capture in one, look in the other. The panel
   shows the device id and event count, which makes "same store or not" obvious.*

Step 2 is the one that matters. A `true` on day one that silently reverts is worse than
a `false`, because the app would be promising durability it does not have — and on this
platform there is no folder mirror underneath to catch it
([ADR-0003](adr/0003-folder-mirror.md) does not exist on iPadOS).

**Consequence if persistence cannot be relied on:** the export/import path in
[ADR-0004](adr/0004-ios-path.md) is not a convenience, it is the durability story, and
the app must be honest about that rather than implying the store is safe.

## V-01 · File System Access API support matrix
**Status: VERIFIED** · 2026-07-27 · web search of MDN, Chrome for Developers, and
Mozilla's standards position

Chromium desktop only — Chrome / Edge / Opera 86+. Firefox does not implement
`showDirectoryPicker()` in any desktop or Android version and has filed a
*harmful* standards position against the local-disk pickers. Safari ships the
Origin Private File System only, and skips the disk pickers entirely.

**Consequence, revised 2026-07-27:** the support matrix is unchanged, but what it
*means* changed when iPadOS became the reference platform. **The folder mirror cannot
exist on the platform this app is actually for.** It is a Chromium-desktop-only
convenience for a secondary environment, not the sync story. Manual export/import via
Files is the sync story ([ADR-0004](adr/0004-ios-path.md)). Per the brief: never
advertise the folder feature where it does not exist — which on the reference platform
means never mentioning it at all. → [ADR-0003](adr/0003-folder-mirror.md)

## V-02 · Cloudflare Workers AI free tier
**Status: VERIFIED** · 2026-07-27 · web search of Cloudflare pricing/blog and
several current secondary sources in agreement

10,000 Neurons/day per account on the Workers Free plan, resetting 00:00 UTC.
The pool is **shared across all models**, and Neuron cost differs sharply by
model — a large model drains it far faster than a small one. Cloudflare's own
estimate is roughly 1,300 small-LLM responses per day. Beyond the pool,
$0.011 per 1,000 Neurons. No card required to stay inside the free allocation.

**Consequence:** ample for v2's consented assist rungs at single-user volume.
Model choice matters more than call count. Does not gate v1 — every AI rung has
an offline rung beneath it (law 10). → [ADR-0015](adr/0015-ai-never-blocks.md)

## V-03 · EU availability of iOS web push
**Status: PARTIAL** · 2026-07-27 · web search; sources agree on half and
contradict on the other half

**Settled:** Apple's removal of home-screen web apps in the EU was *reversed*.
After developer and European Commission pressure, Apple announced on 2024-03-01
that iOS 17.4 would retain home-screen web app support in the EU. Home-screen
installation is not in question.

**Still contradicted:** whether the **Push API** is available to EU home-screen
web apps. Current sources published within months of each other state both
"push works on iOS 16.4+ outside the EU" (implying not inside) and general
availability without an EU carve-out. The brief already recorded this as
"conflicting sources on record" — that remains the honest state, and one more
search did not resolve it.

**Consequence: gates nothing.** Push is T2, which is v2, and the owner is not an
EU user. Re-run this check when T2 is actually being built, against Apple's own
documentation rather than secondary reporting. → [ADR-0007](adr/0007-notification-tiers.md)

## V-04 · Name availability — **the app is Quietkeep**
**Status: PARTIAL** · adopted 2026-07-28 → [ADR-0024](adr/0024-name-quietkeep.md)

PARTIAL, not VERIFIED, and the audit was right to catch the earlier label: every check a
session or a real device could run has run and come back clean — the App Store search and
`quietkeep.pages.dev`, 2026-07-28 — but the USPTO knockout is deliberately **not run** (see
below), and by this file's own status table a question with a leg deferred-with-a-reason is
PARTIAL, not VERIFIED. The name is safe to build on; it is not certified.

Every check a session could run has run, and **both checks that only a real device could
run came back from him** — the App Store search and `quietkeep.pages.dev`, on 2026-07-28.

**The USPTO knockout was not run, and that is a decision rather than a gap.** Trademark
protects against confusion **in commerce**; Quietkeep is free, has no paid tier, and is
licensed against being sold ([ADR-0017](adr/0017-licensing.md)). A live mark on unrelated
goods does not reach it, and the row is left visible here instead of being dropped so that
the reasoning is auditable if the app's status ever changes. **If Quietkeep ever stops
being free, this row reopens.**

### What was run against Quietkeep

- **1**
  - Check: Said out loud
  - Instrument: said, and said in a sentence
  - Result: KWY-ət-keep. One spelling, one pronunciation. No homophone, no biting rhyme, nothing one letter away.
- **2**
  - Check: This repo's own spec
  - Instrument: `grep` — **authoritative**
  - Result: Clear. "quiet" only in prose, "keep" only in ordinary usage. No surface, node kind, event noun, or law is named either.
- **3**
  - Check: Unscoped name + software
  - Instrument: web search
  - Result: Nothing named Quietkeep. Nearest: SoftwareKeep (retailer), Quiet Mind Software, quiet.app, Quiet Modem Project.
- **4**
  - Check: npm + GitHub
  - Instrument: direct registry query — **authoritative**
  - Result: `quietkeep`, `quiet-keep`, `quietkeep-app`, `usequietkeep` all free. No GitHub project of the name.
- **5**
  - Check: **App Store**
  - Instrument: **a real device, 2026-07-28**
  - Result: **nothing near it on the App Store.** **Answered.**
- **6**
  - Check: **`quietkeep.pages.dev`**
  - Instrument: **a real device, 2026-07-28**
  - Result: *"Quietkeep.pages.dev is clean."* **Answered** — Q-04 closed, and the subdomain is the one the deploy targets.
- **—**
  - Check: USPTO classes 9 and 42
  - Result: **Not run, by reasoning** — see above. Reopens if the app ever stops being free.

**Known and accepted, recorded rather than omitted:** **Quietstart: AI Day Planner**
(Google Play) shares the first syllable in the same category — not a collision, but where a
half-remembered name could land. **Quiet, Inc.** holds marks on the bare word *QUIET*; a
compound is not that word, and confusion-in-commerce does not reach a free app licensed
against being sold.

> **Both handed-over checks came back.** These are the first in the naming sequence that

### The order to check a candidate in — **the standing method**

Cheapest and most-likely-to-kill first. Steps 1 and 2 are free and instant; they were
being run last, or not at all.

1. **SAY IT OUT LOUD.** Say it in a sentence. Ask what it rhymes with, what it is one
   letter from, and what it sounds like to someone who has never seen it written.
   *Wynts* passed every registry check and sounds like **wince** — disqualifying for an
   app whose voice is shame-free and never a rebuke. No registry catches that.
2. **Grep this repo's own spec.** Killed *Lens* (the person lens), *Gauge* (the coverage
   gauge) and *Alignment* (the alignment tree).
3. **Unscoped `"<name>" software company app brand`.** Killed *Perennial*, *Parallax*.
4. **npm and GitHub** — authoritative and reachable from a session.
5. **App Store / USPTO** — a real device; blocked from here, proven in V-05.

### The Wynts round — what was run, and why it was not enough

*Kept because the method is the transferable part.*

- **npm registry**
  - Instrument: direct query — **authoritative**
  - Result: `wynts`, `wynt`, `wynts-app`, `usewynts` all free
- **GitHub**
  - Instrument: repo search API — **authoritative**
  - Result: one hit, a personal profile-config repo. No project.
- **App Store**
  - Instrument: web search only
  - Result: nothing named Wynts
- **Unscoped name + software**
  - Instrument: web search only
  - Result: nothing named Wynts
- **This repo's own spec**
  - Instrument: `grep`
  - Result: no internal collision

**Still owed, on a real device:** the App Store search from a real device, and a USPTO
knockout in classes 9 and 42 if wanted. Blocked from a session — proven in V-05, not
assumed. Until those run this row stays **PARTIAL**, not VERIFIED.

**Known and accepted:** nothing is named Wynts, but the phonetic neighbourhood is busy —
**WYNT** (community-hub app, Google Play) is one letter away, plus Wynta, Wynter, Wynk,
Wynd Technologies. Low trademark risk for a free noncommercial planner; the real cost is
a half-remembered name landing on a neighbour. Recorded in ADR-0022.

### The method, which is the part that transfers

Perennial was reported here as "un-killed" on the strength of two searches that **asked
the wrong question**. It is in fact held by **three** software companies — Perennial Labs
(DeFi, and serving `perennial.pages.dev`), Perennial Systems (web dev/fintech), and
Perennial Software (security). Found on device the subdomain occupant himself, on his phone,
in seconds.

The two failing queries were scoped to the app's own category
(`app task planner productivity App Store`) and to the SEO-poisoned `trademark class 9`
shape already documented below in V-09. A single properly-scoped query —
`"Perennial Labs" web development agency` — returned two of the three at once.

> **Ask "is this name taken in software?" — never "is another planner called this?"**
> The narrow query returns a confident empty result for a heavily occupied name. It is a
> weak probe wearing a thorough one's clothes.

**Standing rule for every future candidate:** the unscoped *name + software* query runs
**first**, before any category query and before the name is shown to the owner at all.

### What a session can and cannot do here — proven 2026-07-28, not assumed

A session can *search* but cannot *query*. Web search returns what people have written
about a name; the
authoritative registers are the USPTO database and the store indexes. Both were probed
directly:

- **`itunes.apple.com/search` (Apple's public search API), raw request** — **403** — gateway CONNECT policy denial
- **`tmsearch.uspto.gov` ×2 and `developer.uspto.gov`, raw request** — **403** — same
- **Same URLs via the fetch tool, in case it routed differently** — **403** — same

The environment's network gateway allows a fixed host list; these are outside it. This is
an environment restriction, not a capability gap, and it is the same cause as V-05's
inconclusive `pages.dev` probe. **Recorded because Doctrine §6 permits handing over a
manual step only after proving it impossible from this side — which had been asserted
before it was tested.**

**Per candidate, owed on a real device — but only after the session's own checks pass:**
1. **App Store / Play direct search** — the check most likely to matter. A same-category
   clash is the realistic failure; *Hyperfocus 2* is exactly what this catches.
2. **`<name>.pages.dev`** — ten seconds, and it settles Q-04.
3. **USPTO knockout, classes 9 and 42** — *lowest priority, arguably skippable.* Trademark
   protects against confusion **in commerce**; this app is free, noncommercial, and
   licensed against being sold. A live mark on unrelated goods does not reach it.

**Nothing reaches the owner until the session has run the unscoped name+software query and
reported what it found.** Handing over a check that a search could have answered is what
went wrong with Perennial.

### V-04a · The hub collision — **CORRECTED, and the original was wrong**
**Status: CORRECTED** · originally recorded VERIFIED 2026-07-27 · corrected 2026-07-28

**What this row said, and it was inaccurate:**

> *"Horizons and Clear Horizons, side by side on one index page, will read to any visitor
> as two versions of one product."*

They would not have. `noahjefferson/public/index.html:258` displays the astro app as
**"Astro Planner"** — the name *Clear Horizons* appears only in the URL, and three times
in `accessibility.html`. The collision was real but smaller and differently shaped than
recorded.

**The worse error was what got built on top of it.** This row was used to argue that
"horizons" was *decorative* in the astro app and that the planner had the better claim to
the word. That assumption was never checked. The owner corrected it: **recording your actual
horizon, and using it to compute what is genuinely visible from where you stand, is that
app's core differentiating feature** — something he says no other astro app does. Its
claim is literal; the planner's was figurative.

**Kept visible rather than rewritten.** A wrong `VERIFIED` row is worse than an open one,
because it stops anyone looking again — Doctrine §6. The lesson is the one already in the
family record: *a claim without a test is a guess, and it must be labelled as one.*

**Resolved by the rename.** The planner is now Perennial; there is no collision left.
The astro app's *own* naming inconsistency is open separately as **Q-06**.

## V-05 · `pages.dev` is unreachable from a session — **and that is now proven**
**Status: VERIFIED (as a limitation)** · 2026-07-28

`perennial.pages.dev` and `horizons.pages.dev` both return **HTTP 000** by raw request;
the gateway logs a **403 CONNECT policy denial**, the same refusal it gives
`itunes.apple.com` and `tmsearch.uspto.gov`. The earlier 403 through the fetch tool was
the same cause.

**A session can never answer whether a `pages.dev` subdomain is free.** It is a device
check, permanently. Doctrine §11 already recorded that some sandboxes block `pages.dev`;
this row upgrades that from "some" to "this one, measured".

**What it is not an excuse for.** `perennial.pages.dev` was taken — by Perennial Labs —
and while the *page* could not be loaded, the *occupant* was findable by search all along
and was never searched for. The unreachable probe was real; the unattempted search was
not. See V-04.

## V-06 · GFE Edge policy — PWA install and persistent storage
**Status: WITHDRAWN** · 2026-07-27 · out of scope by owner's decision

Originally: whether the owner's government machine permits installing a PWA and
granting persistent storage under managed Edge policy. It was recorded as gating the
work half.

**Withdrawn because the app is not for that machine.** Stated 2026-07-27: not intended
or designed for GFE. Personal iPad only is my personal intent."* There is nothing to
check, because there is no supported configuration to check it in.

**Kept rather than deleted**, so that a future reader finds the question already
considered and closed instead of raising it again as an oversight.

> **One thing deliberately not claimed.** The owner expects managed-device storage policy
> would block the app anyway if someone tried. That is a reasonable expectation and it
> is **unverified** — no session can test it and no one has. It is recorded here as his
> expectation and **nothing in the design relies on it as a control**. The scope
> statement in [`data-constitution.md`](data-constitution.md) does that work. An
> unverified technical guess is not a safeguard, and treating it as one would be exactly
> the false-confidence failure Doctrine §5 names.

## V-07 · Current-iOS storage behaviour — *superseded framing*
**Status: SUPERSEDED by [V-00](#v-00--ipados-storage-behaviour--the-reference-platform)** · 2026-07-27

Original row, preserved because the reasoning it contained was wrong in a way worth
keeping visible:

> *"Consequence if both are false: none.* The design already assumes the pessimistic
> case — T0 requests notification permission for badge *and* persistence before any
> push mechanism exists, and the iOS path never assumes a second icon shares data. A
> negative answer costs nothing."

That was true **while iPadOS was one platform among several**. Once it became the only
platform in scope, "costs nothing" stopped being accurate — the same failure now has no
desktop mirror underneath it. Re-filed as **V-00**, at the top, as the highest-value
outstanding check. → [ADR-0004](adr/0004-ios-path.md), [ADR-0007](adr/0007-notification-tiers.md)

## V-08 · Competitive pass on the five claimed differentiators
**Status: NOT RUN** · deliberately deferred

The five: decay-based Upkeep lane · unified suspend-capture-resume bound to a
modeled focus state · bother triage terminating in clock-guaranteed routes ·
horizon-integrity engine · pebble load ledger.

**Deferred because** it informs positioning copy in
[`planning-for-humans.md`](planning-for-humans.md) and nothing in v1's design.
No decision waits on it.

**Trigger:** before the first public release copy is written. Deferred, not
dropped — this row is the record that it is owed.

## V-09 · The name-search instrument itself
**Status: VERIFIED** · 2026-07-28 · observed twice in one session

A query containing the phrase **"trademark class 9"** returns SEO articles *about*
trademark classes and no actual products. It happened twice — for *Chroma* and for
*Perennial* — and both times the result was an empty-looking page that could easily have
been read as "nothing is using this name."

**Chroma is in fact heavily occupied** (Razer Chroma is an entire class 9 ecosystem), which
proves the empty result was the instrument, not the world.

**Use plain queries** — `"<name>" app software company brand` — which found real conflicts
every time. And treat any name search that returns only advice articles as a **failed
probe**, not a clean one.

This is the family lesson restated in a new place: *a success response carrying nothing is
not an answer, it is a question.*

## V-10 · The Spine gate had never passed — **found 2026-07-28, and it was cited as proof**
**Status: FIXED · green run observed** (run 5, `721f59e`)

`.github/workflows/spine.yml` is the repo's CI gate: `npm ci` → typecheck → tests →
banned-vocabulary grep. **It failed on all four of its runs, every run since it was
created**, and always on the very first step.

The cause was three characters. `package.json` carried

```json
"test:only": "node --test --experimental-strip-types "test/**/*.test.ts""
```

— unescaped double quotes inside a JSON string, so the file is **not valid JSON**. `npm ci`
dies with `EJSONPARSE` before a single test runs. Every downstream step was skipped, and
the gate was red from the moment it existed.

**The part that matters is not the typo.** Every session, including this one, verified the
spine by running the tools *directly* — `node --experimental-strip-types --test …` and
`npx tsc --noEmit` — which bypass `package.json` entirely and pass. So the local check was
green, the CI check was red, and nobody looked at the second one. A commit message on this
repo says *"Verified: 14/14 spine tests, tsc clean"* while a red run sat on that exact SHA.
Each statement was individually true. Together they described a repo whose gate worked.

This is [§4's fake-gate finding](../ACCESSIBILITY.md) in a second place: **a gate that has
never been observed passing is not a gate, it is a file.** The fix for the class is not
"be careful with JSON" — it is *watch the run*.

- **Runs 1–4** — `failure`, all on `npm ci`, 2026-07-28
- **Cause** — invalid JSON in `package.json` `scripts`
- **Fix** — `test:only` quotes the glob with `'…'`; `test` chains `npm run test:only` rather than repeating it
- **Proven locally** — `rm -rf node_modules && npm ci && npm run typecheck && npm run test:only` — clean install, 14/14, exit 0. The banned-vocabulary step run verbatim: clean.
- ****Proven in CI**** — **Run 5, `721f59e`, `success`** — observed, not assumed. The first green run this workflow has ever had.

> **Addendum, 2026-07-28 evening — the rule was broken by its author the same day.**
> Run 17 (`102af90`) was **red and unwatched**: a `git add -A` on a docs correction swept
> the half-built ⓘ-panel into that commit, pairing the new page with the old smoke test.
> The push whose own commit message was about watching runs went red, and nobody looked
> until the next commit's pre-push check happened to surface it. Run 18 (`da9cb1f`)
> restored green — watched this time. Two mechanical consequences, so this stops being
> willpower: **stage deliberately when the tree holds unrelated in-flight work** (`add -A`
> is how a docs fix ships half a feature), and every push's run gets opened before the next
> claim of green — which is the rule this row already stated.

**And the Deploy workflow's runs were watched too, because that is the whole point of this
row.** Run 1 on `721f59e` and run 3 on `fac16df`: guard step green, **all five deploy steps
`skipped`**, nothing published. Run 3 is the stronger evidence — by then `public/` existed
and held the brand assets, and the guard still skipped, because it tests for
`public/index.html` rather than for the directory. That is the right granularity, and it is
observed rather than reasoned about. Note what it does and does not prove: the *guard*
works, the *deploy* still has not run.

**Every gate has been watched green at least once, and each new gate is watched on the run
that introduces it** — this is a standing practice, not a fixed list, precisely because the
gate set keeps growing (it is now typecheck, tests, changelog, build, smoke, a11y, brand and
banned-vocabulary). Naming a frozen roster here would go stale the next time a gate is added,
which is what the audit found the old sentence doing. The rule is: the run for the commit
that adds or changes a gate is opened before the next claim of green, and the observed run is
recorded in that gate's own row or in NOTES.md's log.

**And watching the runs immediately earned its keep.** Deploy run 7 (`68199ac`) — the
first push with a real `public/index.html` — reported **success and published nothing.**
The runner's own env block says why:

```
RAW_TOKEN:                    ← empty
RAW_ACCOUNT: ***              ← present
Cloudflare secrets not configured — skipping deploy.
```

**Both faults were mine.**

1. **The secret was never missing — it is named `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY`.** The workflow
   read only `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, found nothing, and I reported the secret as absent
   on the strength of an empty variable. An empty read of *the name I chose to look for*

   was no site to publish; the moment `public/index.html` existed it became a green run

**Settled:** the stored value is a **scoped API token** under the name
`CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY`. Deploy run 9 authenticated with `Bearer` and shipped, so the
Global-API-Key path (`X-Auth-Key` + `X-Auth-Email`) is not in use and `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL`
is not needed.

## V-12 · The deployed site would not load, then did — **RESOLVED**
**Status: WORKING** · 2026-07-28

CI published successfully and Safari could not reach the result — then could.

- **`staging.quietkeep.pages.dev`**
  - What it is: branch alias of a **preview** deployment
  - Result on a real iPad: "connection was lost"
- **`2020c8fe.quietkeep.pages.dev`**
  - What it is: hash URL of the **same preview** deployment
  - Result on a real iPad: same
- **`quietkeep.pages.dev`**
  - What it is: **production**, after the promote
  - Result on a real iPad: **loads, and the app runs**

**One variable changed: the project gained its first production deployment.** Same device,
same network throughout — confirmed by the owner, and it was never mine to assume otherwise.

That makes a coherent explanation available without inventing anything. **Both failing URLs
were preview deployments** — the hash URL and its branch alias are two names for one
preview build — and the Pages project had **no production deployment at all**, because it
was created with `--production-branch=main` while `main` still had no `public/`. The apex
worked as soon as production existed. Every observation fits; nothing else changed.

## V-13 · Same-day clocks used end-of-UTC-day, not the user's local day — **FIXED**
**Status: FIXED in 0.5.0** · found by the Phase 2 audit, 2026-07-29 · fixed the same day

**The fix:** `src/time.ts` — a pure, zone-aware primitive (`endOfLocalDay`,
`localDayKey`, `calendarDaysBetween`) that never reads the clock, with the zone
read once at the UI edge (`deviceZone()`) and threaded through `openSession` →
`StampContext` → the gate (`gateOptionsFor(zone)`) and the route intents. The zone
is **not** stored in the log: a clock's `at` is an absolute instant, so it is
zone-independent once computed, and "today" resolving against the *reader's*
zone is exactly what a traveller wants — without rewriting a single stored event.

The display path carried the same class of bug and was fixed with it: `friendly()`
divided elapsed milliseconds by 86_400_000, which says "today" at 23:00 about a
clock two hours away and is an hour out on every DST day. It now counts calendar
days in the reader's zone.

**Proven, made to fail first (§6):** eight zone tests pinned to non-UTC zones
(Denver, Kiritimati at UTC+14, Chatham at UTC+12:45), plus a route-level test that
a do-now routed at 20:30 Denver returns *that evening*. Reverting `endOfLocalDay`
to the old end-of-UTC-day behaviour fails five of them, including the route test.

The original finding is kept below, because a record that explains what was wrong
is worth more than one that only says it is fine now.

---

### The original finding
**Status when found: KNOWN, NOT YET FIXED** · Phase 2 audit, 2026-07-29

The gate's capture cure-clock (`endOfDay`) and the do-now / same-day route clock
(`clockToday` in `triage-intents.ts`) both stamp `setUTCHours(23,59,59)`, i.e. the
end of the **UTC** calendar day, not the end of the *user's local* day. Off the UTC
meridian the "returns today" clock therefore lands on the wrong local day: for a
user east of UTC it can read as tomorrow; for Denver (UTC−6/−7) a capture made
after ~18:00 local is clocked to a time that has already passed in UTC terms and
reads as a dated "returns \<day\>". The Phase 2 a11y gate caught the downstream
symptom — a longer card status than "returns today" overflowed the card at
320px/200%, now fixed by letting `.card-when` wrap.

**Why it was recorded rather than patched on the spot:** it is pre-existing in the
gate and cross-cutting (every clock in the app derives its "day" this way), so the
correct fix is a single timezone-aware primitive threaded through the gate and the
intents — a deliberate change with its own tests, not a one-line patch buried in a
triage commit. It had **no bearing on law 1**: the node is clocked either way,
never silent — only the *label's day* was wrong. That judgement held: the fix
landed as the first step of Phase 3, with its own suite, one release later.

**The check that would confirm it, if anyone wants certainty:** open
`staging.quietkeep.pages.dev` now. Preview aliases should work now that a production
deployment exists. If it does, the explanation above is confirmed; if it still fails,
preview deployments on this project are broken and that is a real bug to chase.

**Proven, not assumed:** all three hosts are unreachable from a session — `CONNECT tunnel
failed, 403`, identical for each, which is [V-05](#v-05--pagesdev-is-unreachable-from-a-session--and-that-is-now-proven)'s
policy denial and says nothing about whether a site is up. **A session cannot diagnose this
row**, which is exactly why the temptation to fill the gap with inference was so strong and
so wrong.

**What happened.** Two sessions running reported the `indexed` topic still needed fixing.
He had already fixed it, before the first of those reports. The report was not a guess — it
was quoted from an API response, which is what made it convincing and what made it wrong.

**The instrument.** GitHub's **search API is a cached index, not a read of current state.**
The tell was in the same payload both times and neither read it:

```
updated_at: 2026-07-28T15:31:07Z    ← frozen, across four subsequent pushes and his edit
topics:     [... "indexed" ...]      ← stale
```

A repository's `updated_at` moves on pushes. Four pushes went by and it did not move. The
response was a snapshot of a moment hours earlier, presented with no indication that it was.

**The other instrument is blocked.** `api.github.com/repos/njefferson/Quietkeep` returns
**403** through this environment's proxy — the same CONNECT policy denial proven in
[V-05](#v-05--pagesdev-is-unreachable-from-a-session--and-that-is-now-proven) and V-04.

**Therefore:** a session **cannot** verify this repo's description, website, topics, or
social preview. Doctrine §10 says list the values and ask the owner to confirm each. **His
confirmation is the verification.** There is no second opinion available, and the thing
being treated as one was a cache.

## V-21 · Can a link open into the installed app at all, or only Safari? — **CLOSED 2026-08-10: ONLY SAFARI, and there is no scheme that changes it**
· raised 2026-08-09 · settled on device, on the owner's iPad, by the only witness there is

**The answer.** It opened **Safari**, not the installed app. The address bar read
`quietkeep-sync.pages.dev`, the app rendered inside a Safari tab, and the capture
landed — *"Held from a link. Undo"*, with `helloworld` sitting on the clarify card.
It worked, into the wrong store, exactly as this row predicted.

Not always, either: sometimes it opened Safari, and sometimes the navigation failed
outright with a service-worker error, which turned out to be a separate defect and
is written up as its own fix in 1.40.2 below.

**So the prediction here was right, and it is the bad outcome.** This row already
said it: *"A capture that lands in the wrong context succeeds — the app says it held
it — into a store nobody opens again. That is the app's one unforgivable failure,
dressed as a confirmation."* That is now an observation rather than a worry.

**What it decides.**

- **The Shortcut route may not be recommended as it stands.** A recipe that reliably
  captures into a store the person does not open is worse than no recipe, because it
  is silent. The ⓘ's copy has to say what actually happens.
- **The fragment entrance and the staged dump page do not rescue it.** `#text=` keeps
  the content off the wire, which is a different and real property, but a fragment
  landing in Safari lands in Safari's IndexedDB just the same. Privacy and
  destination are independent problems and only one of them was ever in hand.
- **`?text=` is untouched and keeps working.** Somebody who opens the app itself and
  captures is unaffected; this is about links arriving from outside.

**What is still NOT known**, and is not assumed here:

- Whether a Shortcut can be made to land in the installed app at all — via a
  different action, a scoped URL, or a Home Screen shortcut rather than *Open URL*.
  Nothing in this row is evidence either way.
- Whether the behaviour differs on iPhone versus iPad, or by iOS version. One
  device, one run of one Shortcut, on iPadOS, on 2026-08-10.
- Whether the two symptoms shared a cause. The service-worker redirect defect is
  fixed and would have produced its own failure regardless of which app opened.

**RESEARCHED 2026-08-10, rather than tested around.** The question "can a link open
into an installed home-screen web app at all" had never been asked; a warning and a
gate were built on top of an assumption instead. What the record actually says:

- **iOS has no link capturing. An `https://` link opens in Safari, always** — whether
  or not it falls inside an installed web app's manifest `scope`. This is the
  platform behaviour, not a Shortcuts quirk, and it is the documented difference from
  Android, where an in-scope URL opens the installed PWA by default. The observation
  above is the platform working as designed.
- **Push notifications are the one long-standing exception** (iOS 16.4+): a
  notification tap can open the installed web app. Even there the URL is unreliable —
  with the app killed it opens at `start_url` and discards the requested one. Not
  usable here regardless: this app sends no notifications, by design.
- **There IS a scheme that lands in the installed app: `webapp://`.** Community
  reported, widely used from Shortcuts, **and absent from Apple's documentation** —
  which is a real risk to weigh, not a footnote. `webapp://host/path` opens the web
  app that was added to the Home Screen for that URL, rather than Safari.
- **And it discards the path and query.** The reported behaviour is that only `/`
  renders: the app is launched at its start URL whatever was asked for. Sources
  disagree on which iOS versions carry it (16.4+ in one account, discovered in the
  iOS 26 betas in another), and that is left unresolved here rather than guessed.

**So the obvious fix is worse than the defect.** Swapping the recipe to
`webapp://…/capture?text=…` would land in the right app and arrive with **nothing**,
because the text rides in the part that gets dropped. Today's failure at least leaves
the note existing somewhere recoverable; that one would lose it silently, which is the
single thing this app may never do.

**What survives both facts, and it is a design rather than a discovery:** carry the
text OUT OF BAND and use the scheme only to arrive. A Shortcut that copies the note to
the clipboard and then opens `webapp://<host>` lands in the installed app; the app,
on arrival, offers to hold what was copied. iOS requires a gesture to read the
clipboard, so it is one deliberate tap rather than an automatic write — which this
repo would want anyway, since a silent write from the clipboard is a capture nobody
asked for.

**AND `webapp://` WAS TESTED ON THE DEVICE, WHICH CLOSES THIS ROW.** A tappable link
to `webapp://quietkeep-sync.pages.dev`, from an unlisted page on the hub, produced:

    Safari cannot open the page because the address is invalid.

Safari does not recognise the scheme at all — not "opens the wrong thing", not
"drops the query". There is nothing there. So the community reports do not hold on
this device and this iOS version, whatever they hold elsewhere, and **the one
mechanism that could have fixed the destination does not exist here.**

**Therefore: there is no way to open a link into the installed app on the reference
platform, and this row is closed rather than deferred.** No Shortcut action, no
scheme, no in-scope URL. The warning in Things you can do is the permanent answer,
and the clipboard design sketched above is moot — it depended on `webapp://` to
arrive in the right place, and there is no arriving in the right place.

**What is left, and it is a different question:** whether the app should offer a
paste-on-arrival path for somebody who copies a note elsewhere and opens the app
themselves. That needs no scheme and no link. It is a product question, unasked,
and deliberately not answered here.

**The control tap found something else, and it was worth more than the test.** An
ordinary `https://…/capture?text=…` link — included only to prove the baseline —
failed on production with *"Response served by service worker has redirections"*.
That is the 1.40.2 defect, live on `quietkeep-sync.pages.dev`, reproducible on
demand, and **not specific to Shortcuts**: any link into the capture entrance can
hit it.

**AND THE FIX IS NOW CONFIRMED ON THE DEVICE, which is what closes it.** The same
link on staging failed too at first — reading as "the fix does not work" — and did
not: the iPad was still being served by an OLD worker, because a new one waits for
the reader's press by design (§7h). After taking the update, the same link loaded
and held its text. Observed, not inferred.

**The lesson in that is worth more than the fix.** A service-worker defect cannot
ship its own cure: the broken worker is the thing that decides whether to accept
the new one, and until somebody presses update, a deployed fix is not a delivered
one. Every gate here can be green, the deploy can be green, and the device can
still be broken. **"Is it deployed" and "is it running on the device that reported
it" are different questions**, and only the second one closes a bug report.

**Production is unfixed as of this row.** `quietkeep.pages.dev` and
`quietkeep-sync.pages.dev` carry 1.39.3, in which every `/capture?text=` link
fails this way. Promoting is the owner's call and has not been made.

## V-24 · A page whose document does not scroll never lets iOS collapse the URL bar — **OPEN, and it is a COST rather than a defect**
· raised 2026-08-18 by ADR-0100, which made the document stop scrolling on purpose

**What is known from here, and it is not the answer.** 2.9.0 makes the page a
flex column of viewport height with one scrolling child, so the frame — capture,
the proof, the destinations — cannot scroll away. That is measured: the
document's scroll area beyond its own box is 0px at both sizes and both stores.

**What follows from that, and cannot be measured from a build machine.** iOS
Safari collapses its URL bar in response to the *document* scrolling. A document
that never scrolls never triggers it, so in a browser tab the reader keeps the
URL bar permanently — roughly 60px — on top of the frame's own 201px. Installed
to the Home Screen there is no URL bar and the cost is zero.

**Why this is recorded rather than fixed.** There is no fix that keeps the frame;
the two are the same mechanism. It is a real cost to browser use and it is the
reason Doctrine §7e's install instructions matter more after this release than
before. If it dominates in practice, ADR-0100 says what happens: the frame
belongs to the installed app and the browser gets the old shell.

**What would settle it:** opening the app in Safari on the reference iPad,
scrolling the list, and saying whether the URL bar stays. One look.

**NOT the same question as whether the layout works.** The flex-column-with-one-
scroller shape is what every sheet in this app has used on that device since
1.40.0, and what replaced `position: sticky` after sticky was found twice not to
hold there. What is new is applying it to the document rather than to a dialog.

## V-22 · The relay's DELETE empties what KV *lists*, and KV `list` is eventually consistent — **UNDERSTOOD, and the gate no longer races it**
· raised 2026-07-30 when Relay run 12 on `c706a64` went red at "Check it actually answers"

> **Renumbered from V-20 on 2026-08-11, because two different rows carried that

> they were in the wrong place.

**What happened.** The deploy succeeded, `/status` was live, GET and OPTIONS
passed, DELETE answered 200 — and the very next GET showed a chunk still present:

    DELETE did not actually empty the mailbox: {"chunks":["1785446320412-39f9acdf7251c2b1"]}

That timestamp decodes to 21:18:40 UTC, **twenty-four minutes before this run's
own POST at 21:43:08.** So the run's own chunk *was* deleted; what survived was an
orphan a prior run left in the one shared test mailbox (`1111…1111`) the check
reused every time. A chunk orphaned by any run that failed before its own cleanup
sits there for the 30-day TTL, and every later run's "confirm empty" trips over
it — a plain re-run can never go green.

**Is this a revocation bug? No.** `emptyMailbox` lists `${id}/` and removes each
key; the worker's `list` adapter paginates to exhaustion (`relay/worker.ts`), so
it under-reports nothing. The route is correct for a store whose `list` is
current. What it cannot outrun is that **Cloudflare KV `list` is eventually
consistent**: a just-written key is not instantly listable, and a just-removed one
is not instantly absent from the listing. Real revocation is unaffected — it
targets *backlog* (chunks written hours or days earlier, long since consistent),
not a chunk written in the same second it is deleted. The one place the race bit
was a health check that wrote, deleted and read back within one second.

**What was fixed.** The gate now (1) uses a **unique mailbox per run+attempt**
(sha256 of `$GITHUB_RUN_ID-$GITHUB_RUN_ATTEMPT`), so no orphan and no concurrent
run can ever contaminate it, and (2) **polls for convergence** — it waits until
the POSTed chunk is listable before deleting (so DELETE lists a set that actually
contains it), then waits up to ~60s for the listing to go empty, re-issuing the
idempotent DELETE each round. Racing KV's consistency window is what made a
working route look broken; the gate now respects the window the platform documents.

**The honest residual.** A chunk written into a mailbox in the few seconds *before*
a revoke may not be listable when the revoke runs, and so may survive until the
next empty or its TTL. That is acceptable for what revocation is *for*, and it is
recorded here rather than papered over with a claim of instant, total erasure.

## V-20 · Does clearing the browser's website data take a Home Screen app's store? — **NEEDS THE OWNER'S HANDS**
· raised 2026-08-02, asking whether clearing Safari's website data loses everything

**What is already settled, from the spec rather than from a device.** Persistent
storage means the browser will not clear the store **on its own** to make room.
It has never covered a person clearing their own website data — that is the one
case the mode is defined as being outside. So the answer is almost certainly yes,
and the app's copy is worded from that definition, which needs no measurement.

**What is NOT settled, and is why this row exists.** Whether iOS's
Settings → Safari → *Clear History and Website Data* actually reaches a Home
Screen web app's IndexedDB for the same origin. [V-00](#v-00--ipados-storage-behaviour--the-reference-platform)
measured the persistence grant, ~38 GB of quota and a force-quit survival on
a real iPad; it never went near this path, and this repo does not put a platform
fact on screen it has not run.

**The run, and it verifies the feature at the same time.** It is safe precisely
because the walk *is* the restore walk:

1. Export a copy from the ⓘ panel, and confirm the file is really in Files.
2. Note what "Last copy" says.
3. Clear Safari's history and website data.
4. Open Quietkeep from the Home Screen. Record what it shows — is it empty? Does
   the walkthrough run again? Is the "Bring a copy back" offer on screen?
5. Take that offer and restore from the file. Confirm the store comes back whole.

**Either outcome is worth having.** If the store survives, the persistence
sentence in the panel is overstated and gets narrowed to what was measured. If it
does not, the sentence is right, the Restore path has been proven on the day it
would be needed, and ADR-0004's durability story has been walked end to end for
the first time on real hardware.

## V-19 · The relay's write limiter is live, and rides on an experimental binding — **VERIFIED, with a named fragility**
· raised 2026-07-30 with the security audit's quota-exhaustion finding

**What was checked, and how.** Relay run 7 on `6438103` printed its binding table:

    env.CHUNKS (***)                KV Namespace
    env.WRITE_LIMIT (ratelimit)     Unsafe Metadata

so the limiter is attached to the deployed Worker, not merely present in
`wrangler.toml`. The same run then confirmed the relay still answers — HTTP 200
with `{"chunks":[]}` on the first attempt, and a 204 to the OPTIONS preflight, so
adding the binding broke neither reading nor cross-origin use.

**The fragility, stated rather than discovered later.** The same deploy warned:

    "unsafe" fields are experimental and may change or break at any time.

Cloudflare's rate-limiting binding is declared under `[[unsafe.bindings]]`, and
that is the *only* control bounding a stranger's ability to spend the daily KV
write quota. So the defence rests on an interface its vendor reserves the right
to change. Two consequences worth holding:

- **A future wrangler could reject or ignore this stanza.** Rejecting is the safe
  failure: the relay deploy goes red and the previous Worker keeps serving.
  Ignoring is the dangerous one — the deploy succeeds, the binding is silently
  absent, `allowWrite` is undefined, and the relay fails OPEN with nothing red
  anywhere. That is the shape this repo keeps finding, and it is not currently
  gated.
- **The fail-open default is deliberate** (`relay/worker.ts`): the relay is
  self-hostable, the limiter is Cloudflare-specific, and refusing every write on
  a missing binding would turn a misconfiguration into total transfer failure for
  a service whose worst untrusted-input outcome is a spent quota. That trade is
  right, and it is exactly what makes the silent-ignore case invisible.

**Closed in the same commit that raised it.** The relay workflow now greps
wrangler's own applied-binding table for `WRITE_LIMIT` and fails the deploy if it
is absent — the same move as checking that the relay answers rather than trusting
that it deployed. A silently-dropped binding is now red, not invisible.

**What this does NOT protect against.** A distributed flood from many addresses:
the limit is per caller, so many callers each stay under it. Nothing here is a
confidentiality or integrity control — a stranger can still neither read nor
corrupt a mailbox, because that rests on the 128-bit sync id and on the seal.
The limiter bounds *availability* damage only.

---

## V-18 · The Cloudflare credential cannot deploy a Worker or create a KV namespace — **VERIFIED, and it blocks the relay**
· raised 2026-07-30 with the first real run of `.github/workflows/relay.yml`

**What was checked, and how.** The relay workflow ran on `ea38768` and failed at
the KV step with wrangler's `Authentication error [code: 10000]` — a message that
names no permission, no endpoint and no fix. The evidence that explains it was
already in a Deploy run's log from twenty minutes earlier:

- the secret is stored as `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY`, 53 characters, and
  `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL` is unset;
- `GET /user/tokens/verify` answers `success: false, code 1000 Invalid API Token`;
- and yet `wrangler pages deploy` **succeeds** with the same value, publishing to
  staging.quietkeep.pages.dev.

Those two facts are only consistent one way: it is an **account-owned scoped API
token**. `/user/...` endpoints do not apply to one, which is why verify rejects it,
and its permissions include Cloudflare Pages and not Workers.

**What follows, and what does not.**

- Quietkeep — the default edition — is entirely unaffected. It has no relay, by
  design, and deploys exactly as it always has.
- Quietkeep Sync cannot exist until the token is widened. Not "is untested":
  cannot be deployed at all, because the relay has nowhere to store a chunk.
- The two permissions to add are **Account → Workers KV Storage → Edit** and
  **Account → Workers Scripts → Edit**. Nothing needs renaming and no new secret
  is needed. This is a dashboard action; the session token cannot perform it
  (Doctrine §10 applies — it is listed for the owner, not done unilaterally).

**The trap this row exists to close.** `RELAY_HOST` briefly held a *guess* at the
workers.dev URL, and every gate passed: the format check, the CSP generation, the
bundle check. A sync build shipped that way would dial a host that does not exist
and report nothing wrong on any device — an app broken in the one way that
produces no error. It now reads `UNSET`, and `tools/editions.mjs` builds no sync
edition while it does. **An unverified URL is not a weaker fact than a missing
one; it is a worse one, because it silences the check that would have caught it.**

## V-17 · Will a real camera read the QR this encoder produces? — **NOT VERIFIED, and it is the only check that counts**
· raised 2026-07-30 with `src/qr.ts`

The encoder is built and heavily tested. **None of those tests can establish the one
thing that matters.**

What IS established here, and from first principles rather than from tables:

- **GF(256) arithmetic** — against the field axioms: commutativity, associativity,
  distributivity over XOR, and the existence of an inverse for all 255 non-zero
  elements. Not a pasted table, which is a page of digits nobody checks.
- **The Reed-Solomon codeword** — against its DEFINING property: every syndrome is
  zero, i.e. the codeword is divisible by the generator. This is derivable and it
  catches any error in the generator polynomial or the remainder. Corrupting one
  symbol is asserted to break it, so the check has power.
- **The geometry** — total codewords is COUNTED from the free modules of a laid-out
  matrix, not looked up, and the data stream is asserted to fill that region exactly
  with at most seven remainder bits. Every data position is visited exactly once.
- **The structure** — three finders and no fourth, separators, timing patterns,
  alignment, the dark module, both copies of the format information agreeing.
- **The mask is chosen** by the specified penalty score, and each penalty rule is
  measured as a delta from a checkerboard so it is attributable.

**What is NOT established, and cannot be here:**

- **the data/EC split for a version and level**
  - By what: nothing. `EC_CODEWORDS` in `src/qr.ts` is the one table recited rather
    than derived, and it is the sole reason this entry exists.
  - Why no test can see it: a wrong entry produces a matrix that is well formed in
    every way the tests examine — correct size, correct patterns, valid RS over
    whatever it thinks the data is — and that no scanner will read. The round trip in
    `test/qr.test.ts` would still pass, **because the reader would be wrong in exactly
    the same way in both directions.** That is the shape of a test verifying its own
    fake, which this project has already been caught by four times.
  - What would settle it: point a phone camera at one. Once.

- **that iOS opens the scanned link in the installed app rather than Safari**
  - Already [V-16]. The two are separate: V-17 is "is it a valid QR", V-16 is "does
    landing on it work". A pass on one says nothing about the other.

**Two bugs the tests DID catch while it was being written**, which is the argument for
the tests that exist rather than against them: the data-placement zigzag skipped the
timing column only when a pair *started* on it, so four modules were written twice and
column 6 never; and the format-information strip overwrote the timing patterns where
they cross and turned the dark module light. The second was invisible to every
count-based check — the reserved set was unchanged — and would have been invisible to
a camera only in the sense that the camera would simply have failed.

**Until this is verified, no surface may describe pairing as working.** The encoder is
infrastructure, unwired, exactly like `seal.ts`, `relay.ts` and `sync.ts`.

## V-16 · Can an iPad web app scan a QR code at all? — **NOT VERIFIED, and it decides the pairing design**
· raised 2026-07-30 with the sync stage 4 decision

The choice was the QR route for pairing, and the *showing* half is easy — an encoder
for one fixed size is about two hundred lines and no dependency. **The scanning
half is the part that may not exist.**

What I believe and have NOT verified here:

- **`BarcodeDetector` is a Chromium API.** WebKit does not implement it, so an
  in-page scanner on an iPad would need a QR **decoder** shipped in the bundle,
  reading frames off a `getUserMedia` stream. That is a far larger dependency than
  the encoder, it needs camera permission from the web app, and it is exactly the
  kind of supply-chain surface this project avoids — for a screen shown twice in a
  device's lifetime.
  - By what: nothing. Stated from memory, which is not evidence.
  - How to settle it: on the iPad, open the app and evaluate
    `'BarcodeDetector' in window`. One line, one answer.

**The design that makes the question mostly moot.** Encode a URL rather than a
bare key, with the key in the **fragment**:

`https://<sync-host>/pair#k=<44 chars>`

The target device scans it with the **built-in Camera app**, which every iOS user
already knows and which needs no permission from us, and iOS opens the link. A
fragment is never transmitted to a server by any browser, so the key stays on the
device even though it travelled inside a URL. Then only the ENCODER ships, there is
no camera code, no `getUserMedia`, and no decoder.

**What only the owner can settle, and it is the real risk:** whether iOS opens that link
in the **installed PWA** or in Safari. If Safari, the key lands in a different
origin storage context than the installed app, and pairing would appear to succeed
and then quietly not work — the exact silent-wrong-state this project refuses. It
must be checked on the device before the flow is built, not after.

- **the link opens in the installed app, not Safari**
  - By what: nothing yet
  - What would prove it: install the Sync app, scan a `/pair#…` QR with the Camera
    app, and see which one comes to the front
  - What it does NOT prove either way: anything about the key itself

**On the owner's mutual-scan idea.** The instinct is right and it is worth keeping: a
one-way scan proves the target saw *a* code, not that both devices ended up holding
the same key, so a mis-scan surfaces later as an exchange that silently moves
nothing. The cheap form of the same check is not a second scan (which hits the same
missing API from the other direction) but **both devices displaying the sync id
derived from the key, for a human to compare**. Two short strings, side by side,
and pairing either completes verified or fails while somebody is still standing
there able to retry.

The whole point of [T1](adr/0007-notification-tiers.md) is that the reminder
arrives **when Quietkeep is not running**. Everything CI can prove about it is
upstream of that claim:

- **the file is well-formed RFC 5545**
  - By what: `test/ics.test.ts`, an independent unfold
  - What it does NOT prove: that a calendar app accepts it
- **one `VALARM` per `VEVENT`**
  - By what: unit + smoke
  - What it does NOT prove: that the alarm ever fires
- **the date is the reader's local day**
  - By what: oracle-tested `localDayKey` (V-13)
  - What it does NOT prove: that iOS agrees
- **`TRIGGER;RELATED=START:PT9H` is emitted**
  - By what: unit
  - What it does NOT prove: that it resolves to **09:00 local** rather than 09:00 UTC, or midnight, or not at all

**The device reading needed**, on a real iPad, which is the reference platform:
1. Export from Quietkeep, open the `.ics`, add it to the calendar.
2. Confirm the event lands on the **right day** — not a day either side.
3. **Close Quietkeep entirely** and confirm a notification arrives at 09:00 local.
4. Re-export after changing a date, re-import, and confirm the event is **updated
   rather than duplicated** — the stable-`UID` claim in
   [ADR-0033](adr/0033-calendar-export-t1.md).

Until step 3 is observed, **T1 is built but unproven**, and nothing should describe
Quietkeep as reminding anyone. The changelog wording for 0.8.0 says the calendar
reminds you, which is a claim about the calendar's behaviour rather than the app's
— if step 3 fails, that copy is wrong and goes first.

**The shipped copy was audited against this and one sentence failed it.** The
panel's confirmation after sending to the calendar read *"it will remind you at
9am on the day"* — an assertion both that a reminder arrives and that it arrives
at nine, which is the exact resolution step 4 exists to check. It was the one
string shown at the moment of the act, and it is now *"each item carries a 9am
alarm for its day, and your calendar is what decides to ring"*: what the file
provably contains, with the ringing attributed to the thing that does it.

The rest of the reminder copy was checked and left alone, because it was already
right — "Quietkeep does not send notifications" and "your calendar runs even when
this app is closed, so it is the thing that **can** actually reach you" are a
true statement about the app and a modal one about calendars, neither of which
this verification touches.

**This raises the value of step 3 rather than lowering it.** The research sweep
found that the modal outcome for a tool in this category is abandonment inside a
month, and that during an avoidance episode the OS-calendar export is the only
component still working — so it carries the whole value proposition precisely
when nothing else in the product is running. That makes an unobserved alarm the
single most consequential unknown in the app, not a tidy-up.

**Why it is recorded rather than assumed:** [V-10](#v-10) is the standing lesson
that running a thing is not the same as watching it, and this is the same shape at
one remove — generating a correct file is not the same as a reminder arriving.

## V-15 · A promote is confirmed by the deploy run, never by reading production
**Status: VERIFIED and CLOSED, 2026-08-04. Production has been read. The
statement in this row's title is no longer true, and that is the point.**
· raised 2026-07-29 with the 0.9.0 promote, and caveated every promote since
· closed by the §7f diagnostic running on a real device, not by a session

**PRODUCTION, READ. The bytes, and where each came from.** After 1.18.0 was
promoted on 2026-08-04, the owner sent a diagnostic from the instance installed on his
home screen and confirmed in his own words that its URL is the plain one — the
production sync host, `quietkeep-sync.pages.dev`, not staging. It reported:

    Build: 1.18.0
    Edition: sync
    Service worker cache: quietkeep-sync-1.18.0

**Why that string is evidence and not an echo**, which is the whole question this
row has been asking for six releases:

- `src/ui/about.ts:1647` reads it from **live Cache Storage** —
  `globalThis.caches?.keys()` — not from a compiled-in constant. A version stamp
  would prove nothing here; §7f and §7h both say so.
- Cache Storage is **per-origin**, so the cache read is the one belonging to the
  host he named.
- The cache is created by the service worker the browser **fetched over the
  network**, and its name is the `CACHE` constant inside that fetched `sw.js`.
- That constant carries the release triplet and is bumped with it, and the sync
  edition's name is DERIVED from it rather than set separately —
  `tools/editions.mjs:132` rewrites `quietkeep-(\d+\.\d+\.\d+)` to
  `quietkeep-sync-$1`. So `quietkeep-sync-1.18.0` cannot be produced by anything
  except a deployed `sw.js` built from the 1.18.0 commit.
- Before the promote the production sync host served 1.17.4, so a
  `quietkeep-sync-1.18.0` cache could not have existed on that origin at all.

**Therefore: the deployed `sw.js` on production carries the released triplet.**
That is the exact claim this row was created to say nobody could make.

**What has NOT changed, and must not be read as changed.** A session still
cannot fetch `pages.dev` — every host is refused `403` at CONNECT, measured
again on 2026-08-03 in a fresh container, and that stands as its own record
below. **Production was not read by a session. It was read by a real device and
reported as text**, which is Doctrine §7f working exactly as written: the check
went where the device could run it, and the answer came back better than the
fetch would have been, because it came from the real device on the real network.

**What this changes for every promote after this one.** The caveat that has been
attached to all six promotes in this repo — *the evidence is the deploy run's own
green step, which is weaker than a fetch* — is retired. The confirmation is now
one paste, and it is stronger than the fetch a session ever wanted.

**The honest cost, recorded because this file is for that.** This row could have
closed an hour earlier. The report carried everything needed except the name of
the origin it came from, so the question had to go back to the owner, who answered it
in two words. The missing `location.origin` line is logged below and is now the
first thing to add to the diagnostic — a report that cannot say where it came
from cannot close a verification on its own.

**What closed the staging half, and it took no new code.** The owner sent the §7f
diagnostic from his device on 2026-08-03. It reported:

    Build: 1.18.0
    Service worker cache: quietkeep-1.18.0

That second line is **read from the live Cache Storage**, not printed from a
compiled-in constant — `src/ui/about.ts:1647` calls `globalThis.caches?.keys()`
and takes the `quietkeep-` entry. The cache is created by the service worker
that the browser fetched over the network, and its name is the `CACHE` constant
inside that fetched `sw.js`. So a real device, on the real network path, has now
demonstrated that the deployed `sw.js` carries the released triplet — which is
exactly the assertion this row said no session could make.

**Stated precisely, because the distinction is the whole point of this file.**
At the time, only this much was proven: the origin serving build 1.18.0 served a
`sw.js` whose `CACHE` was `quietkeep-1.18.0`, matching `staging`'s commit, at the
moment the worker installed on his device. That the origin was
`staging.quietkeep.pages.dev` was **inferred, not read** — 1.18.0 existed only on
`staging`, so the inference was sound, and it was still an inference. Production
was untouched: it served 1.17.4, which ships no diagnostic at all, so no report
could be taken from it by anyone.

**Both of those are now settled by the production reading above**, and the
sequence is kept rather than tidied because it is the argument for the fix: the
staging report was one line short of self-sufficient, and so was the production
one.

**Why this is worth more than the fetch the session wanted.** Doctrine §7f says
to put the check where the device can run it. The instrument that answered this
was already built, in 1.18.0, for a different purpose — and it answered a
question the session had just spent its budget failing to answer from the
sandbox. The lesson is not "build a probe"; it is **ask what the instrument you
already shipped can already tell you** before designing a new one.

Every promote in this repo has been reported as verified end-to-end. That is true
of the *pipeline* and not of the *site*. The session cannot fetch
`quietkeep.pages.dev` at all: the environment's network policy denies it, and the
agent proxy answers `403` to the CONNECT, which is a policy decision and not a
site failure (`curl "$HTTPS_PROXY/__agentproxy/status"` logs the rejection by
host). So the chain a session can actually observe ends one step short:

- **every spine gate passed**
  - How: the run opened and read step by step (V-10)
  - What it does NOT prove: that the built artefact is what deploys
- **Cloudflare Pages accepted the upload**
  - How: the deploy run's own step, watched green
  - What it does NOT prove: that the apex URL serves it
- **the triplet in the commit**
  - How: `git`, locally
  - What it does NOT prove: that the **deployed** `sw.js` carries it

**What closes the production half: THE PROMOTE, and nothing before it.**

Production is 1.17.4 and **1.17.4 has no diagnostic** — the surface shipped in
1.18.0, which is still on `staging`. There is no control to press on
`quietkeep.pages.dev` and no report to take from it. A session asked the owner for one
anyway on 2026-08-03; he answered *"there's no way to get data from main since it
doesn't have that ability"*, and he was right. Checked afterwards rather than
before: `origin/main` carries no diagnostic source at all, and its only
`caches.keys()` is the eviction sweep inside `sw.js`, which no page can read.

That is a §6 failure and the plainest kind — a manual step handed over that was
impossible, when both facts needed to rule it out (production is 1.17.4; the
diagnostic landed in 1.18.0) were already written down **in this very file** by
the session that asked. Verifying the step would have cost one `git ls-tree`.

**The consequence is better than the mistake.** The production half of this row
is not waiting on the owner to go and look — it is **blocked on the promote**, and it
unblocks itself the moment 1.18.0 reaches production. So:

- **Do not ask for a production diagnostic before 1.18.0 is promoted.** There is
  nothing there to answer with.
- **Do not substitute the on-screen build stamp.** 1.17.4 has one, and reading it
  would prove only what the app *reports* — which is exactly the weaker claim
  §7f and §7h warn about, since a stamp cannot tell "this is current" from "this
  is what the cache still holds". It would not close this row, so asking for it
  is a second goose chase for evidence that arrives insufficient.
- **After the promote, one paste closes it**, and every promote after that is
  confirmable the same way.

**Which makes 1.18.0 the release that ends this row's whole class of problem.**
V-15 has been open since 0.9.0 for one reason: no release before this one carried
an instrument that could answer it. The staging half is already proven above. The
mechanism works; only the production instance is unmeasured, and the promote is
what measures it.

**The missing origin line has now cost a verification, one hour after it was
logged.** On 2026-08-04, after the promote, the owner sent a diagnostic from his real
instance reading `Service worker cache: quietkeep-sync-1.18.0`. Since the promote
BOTH `quietkeep-sync.pages.dev` and `staging.quietkeep-sync.pages.dev` serve
1.18.0, so that string cannot say which one he was standing on — and before the
promote only staging did, which is what makes the question live rather than
pedantic. **The production half stays open on a one-line omission**, in a report
that otherwise carries everything needed to close it. Promote the origin line
from cosmetic to blocking.

**"Devices seen in the log" answers a different question than it appears to, and
that is the same defect class as the missing `maxTouchPoints`.** A device id is
minted once per STORE and kept in IndexedDB (`src/ui/session.ts:83`), and
IndexedDB is per-origin — so the default edition and the sync edition each get
their own id **on the same iPad**, staging and production each get their own, and
clearing website data mints a fresh one on the same hardware. `state.devices` is
just the set of `e.device` over the log (`src/fold.ts:522`). The line says
"devices" and a reader hears hardware.

Recorded because a reasonable reading of it was wrong in both directions: the owner
read three ids as including the OmniFocus import, which cannot be — that import
runs through `session.commit` and stamps the importing store's own id
(`src/taskpaper.ts:235`, called at `src/ui/about.ts:1482`) — while the count
genuinely can exceed the number of machines, for reasons the wording hides. A
Quietkeep export imported from another instance DOES bring its id, since events
keep their origin device; a TaskPaper import does not. **Say "stores" and name
them**, or the number invites exactly this.

**Three things the diagnostic should gain, all found by reading the first report
against this row:**

- **Name the origin.** `location.origin` in the device block. Without it the
  reader of a report has to infer which site was loaded from the version number,
  which works only while the two branches differ.
- **List every cache, not the first match.** `caches.keys()` is already called;
  the report prints one entry. Two caches on a device is the exact signature of
  a half-finished update, and §7h.4 asks for which caches are held.
- **Say whether a worker is waiting**, per §7h.4 — `registration.waiting != null`
  and whether one controls the page.

**Re-tested 2026-08-03, after word that pages.dev had been allowed —
STILL DENIED from this session, and the distinction matters.** Both hosts were
tried and both were refused at the gateway, logged by the proxy itself:

- `quietkeep.pages.dev:443` — `gateway answered 403 to CONNECT` at 18:35:10Z
- `staging.quietkeep.pages.dev:443` — the same, at 18:35:11Z

The policy is **deny-by-default with an allowlist**, measured rather than
assumed: `api.github.com` answers 200 from here while `example.com` and
`cloudflare.com` are refused identically to pages.dev. So this is not a
Quietkeep-specific block and not a site failure.

That session's explanation was that **a session's egress policy is bound when
its container starts**, so a grant made mid-session cannot reach a session
already running, and a fresh session was the thing to try.

**Tried, 2026-08-03, in a fresh container — and that explanation is now
falsified as a sufficient one.** This container booted at `19:42:51Z` (the
repos were cloned into it at `19:42:58Z` and `19:43:01Z`) and the first denial
was logged at `19:43:30.676Z` — thirty-nine seconds into the life of a brand
new session. A container-start binding would have picked the grant up. It did
not. So the grant is not reaching sessions at all, rather than merely failing
to reach the one that was already running, and the next session should not
spend its budget re-testing the container-age theory.

**It is not per-project, and not per-branch either.** Every host was refused
once each, at the gateway, logged by the proxy by name:

- `quietkeep.pages.dev:443` — 403 to CONNECT, `19:43:30.676Z`
- `staging.quietkeep.pages.dev:443` — 403 to CONNECT, `19:45:57.053Z`
- `quietkeep-sync.pages.dev:443` — 403 to CONNECT, `19:45:57.852Z`
- `staging.quietkeep-sync.pages.dev:443` — 403 to CONNECT, `19:45:58.199Z`
- `noahjefferson.pages.dev:443` — 403 to CONNECT, `19:45:58.519Z`

The hub's own site is in that list. Whatever the grant did, it did not put the
`pages.dev` space on this session's allowlist for any project the owner owns.

**And the network is emphatically not the problem** — Doctrine §15b requires
this be measured per host and stated with codes rather than asserted, so it
was: `api.github.com` returns 200, `registry.npmjs.org` returns 200,
`raw.githubusercontent.com` returns 301, `github.com` returns 400. Status codes
coming back mean the proxy is healthy and passing traffic. `example.com` is
refused identically to `pages.dev`, which places this as **deny-by-default with
an allowlist that GitHub and the package registries are on and the general web
is not**. That is a policy decision about hosts, not a site failure and not a
connectivity failure.

Each host was probed exactly once. Doctrine §15b item 3 is why the other four
were probed at all — a CONNECT rejection is a fact about one host at one moment,
separate allowlist entries answer separately, and reporting "pages.dev is
blocked" off a single refusal would have missed that the hub is blocked too.
The agent-proxy README's rule against retrying a policy denial binds the
*denied host*, and no host here was tried twice.

**Why it is recorded rather than shrugged off:** the wording "verified end-to-end"
has appeared in this repo's log for five promotes, and it overstates what was
seen — the same class of error as [V-10](#v-10), where running a thing was
reported as watching it. A deploy step going green is good evidence and it is not
the same as production serving the file.

## Standing note on instruments

Two lessons from sibling apps apply to every future row here:

- **A success response carrying nothing is not an answer — it is a question.**
  An HTTP 200 with an empty body, or a search returning no hits, is not evidence
  of absence. This is the shape that made the early Perennial searches read as
  clean when the name was taken; V-04 now carries its evidence explicitly.
- **When a result looks absurd, suspect the instrument first.** V-05's 403 is the
  instrument, not the answer.
- **Running the command is not the same as watching the gate.** V-10: the spine's
  CI failed on all four runs while every session reported the same tests passing,
  because the local invocation and the CI invocation took different paths. If a
  workflow is going to be *cited* as verification, its run has to be opened.
- **A cached index answering instantly is not a current read.** V-11: a search
  API returned a topic list hours out of date, with its own stale `updated_at`
  sitting in the same response. This is V-04's confident-empty-result in a new
  costume — the failure is trusting an instrument's *fluency* instead of asking
  what it actually measures and when it last measured it.
- **When the only witness is the owner, ask clearly and believe the answer.**
  V-11 again: a weaker instrument was used to contradict him about his own repo.
