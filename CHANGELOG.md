# Changelog

What changed, written for the person using Quietkeep rather than for whoever
wrote it (Doctrine §5). Patch notes tell the truth: no absolutes the tests do
not back (§14).

Numbering is `version.capability.iteration` (§7). Each release is exactly one
kind — **VERSION** changes what the app is, **CAPABILITY** means it can do
something it could not, **ITERATION** refines something that already exists.

**Releases do not have names.** No monikers, no codenames — a release is its
triplet and what it did for you.

> Generated from `src/ui/changelog.ts`, which is what the app itself shows in
> its (i) panel. Edit that, then run `npm run changelog`. Don't edit this file.

## 1.38.4 — ITERATION

*2026-08-09*

- **Send to my calendar is now at the top of the ⓘ panel, under *Things you can do*; it was most of the way down, under “Reminders that reach you”.** Finding it meant scrolling and reading. The panel pointed at it four times with the word “below”, which is what you end up doing when a button is in the wrong place.
- **And the panel is 848 words shorter.** Seven sections explaining features ran to over a thousand words of reasoning. They now say what the thing is and what it does, in a sentence or two. The reasoning has not been deleted — it lives in *Planning for Humans*, which is where reasoning belongs.
- This is a first pass, not the end of it: the panel is still far longer than it should be.

## 1.38.3 — ITERATION

*2026-08-09*

- **The calendar hand-off says what it does, without hedging.** It was worded cautiously because nobody here had watched an alarm arrive. You have used it; it works. The caution is gone.

## 1.38.2 — ITERATION

*2026-08-09*

- **A day you have picked but not kept now says so.** Choosing a date fills the field the moment you choose it, which looked exactly like a date that had been saved — and only *Set* actually saves it. So a date could be picked, believed, and simply not be there. It now reads “Not kept yet — press Set.” until the two agree, and then it goes.
- **The same for a start day and for when an answer is owed** — all three worked this way and none of them said so.
- **And when the browser refuses to keep your data, it tells you.** Pressing *Keep my data on this device* did nothing visible if the browser said no — no answer, no reason, a button that read as broken. It now says what happened: that nothing is lost either way, that your writing is on this device regardless, and that the browser has simply not promised to keep it if it runs short of room.

## 1.38.1 — ITERATION

*2026-08-09*

- **How things come round now follows the day you set, not the calendar’s.** If your day ends at 3am, a weekly thing used to come back at midnight — in the middle of an evening you had not finished — and start asking. It waits for your day to actually end.
- **The same for how long you have been waiting on somebody**, how long a place has been quiet, and how long you have been away. All four counted in calendar days and none of them knew whose day they meant.
- **Nothing moves for anybody who has not set a boundary.** An unset day still ends at midnight, so this changes nothing at all unless you asked for it — and it never changes how insistent something is, only when it starts.

## 1.38.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-09*

- **The Menu button is now the last control in the top row; it was the second to last.** One new button, *More room*, sits in the capture form ahead of it. Nothing else changed position.
- **The capture box is exactly where it was, and its recorded name is now the question it asks — “What do you want to put down?”; it was “Hold it”.** That was the button’s words, kept against the box by mistake. Nothing you see or press has changed.
- **Room for a whole meeting, one thing per line.** *More room* turns the capture line into a page you can write a list into. Nothing is held until you press the same button you always press — you can leave it half-written, close the app, and it will still be there next week, still unheld.
- **And pasting a written list into the capture line now works.** It used to run every line together into one unreadable item, because a single-line box quietly deletes the line breaks in anything you paste. The lines are kept now: the paste opens with room, and says it will be held as one thing per line — with *Hold it as one thing* there if it was really one thing all along, like an address.
- Still true, and deliberately: nothing is sorted, split or filed on the way in, and nothing is counted on the way out.

## 1.37.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-09*

- **The one thing today that will not move, named on the main screen.** Not a countdown and not an alarm — your calendar holds those. Just the name of it, where you can catch it without going looking, because the hours before something fixed stop feeling like usable time when you cannot remember what it was.
- **Nothing you capture from a link is sent anywhere now.** Opening a capture address put whatever it carried into the request to the server that hosts the app — fine for “buy milk”, wrong for the notes from a meeting, which is exactly what that entrance is for. It stays on your device. The first visit on a brand-new browser is still the old way round, and that is being fixed separately rather than quietly.
- **This release also delivers a feature that was written but never reached you.** The fixed-thing line was built and pushed on 9 August without a version bump, so every installed copy kept serving the older app and had no way to know. It is here now, and the build refuses to repeat it.

## 1.36.2 — ITERATION

*2026-08-09*

- **The walkthrough now teaches what actually happens each day.** It stopped at “it hands you the thing worth doing” and never said what that looks like or what to do with it — so the two halves people meet first, acting on an offer and having a bad day, were the two it left out.
- **Two new steps.** One thing at a time: why each offer says why it is there, that *Not this* costs nothing and records nothing, and that finishing makes the screen settle and wait. And: not every day is the same — how heavy a thing is, how the day is going, and *Just one thing* for when the screen itself is too much.
- Six steps now, still skippable, and still there whenever you want it under *How to use it*.

## 1.36.1 — ITERATION

*2026-08-09*

- **Quietkeep now explains the half of itself it had gone quiet about.** Seven new entries in the ⓘ panel: how the offer chooses and why each thing says what it is doing there, what happens when you finish something, saying how heavy a thing is, saying how the day is going, *Just one thing*, the when-and-where line, and how long things take.
- **The one most worth reading is the pause after finishing.** Nothing new arrives until you ask for it, and that gap is on purpose — but until now the only place that was said was on the screen at the time. If you wondered about it afterwards there was nowhere to go and check, which makes a deliberate thing look like a fault.
- Everything described was already there and nothing about the app changed. What changed is that it can now be looked up.

## 1.36.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-08*

- **There is now a “Just one thing” button on the offer.** Press it and the screen shows one thing to do and almost nothing else — no reason line, no where-it-sits, no what-it-holds-up, no list of what is behind, no counts, no chips. Larger type, and nothing moves.
- **This is for the days when the problem is not how much there is.** Being offered easier work helps when the day is heavy. It helps not at all when the difficulty is reading the screen at all — when every true and useful line on it is one more thing to process. Those are different bad days and until now the app only had an answer for one of them.
- **Leaving it is one visible tap**, in the same place, always on screen. That is the whole design: this is also what a screen should look like when operating an app is itself one of the things that has become hard, so the way out cannot be somewhere you have to find.
- **Nothing turns it on for you and nothing suggests it.** Quietkeep does not work out what kind of day you are having — it has no way to know, and guessing would mean forming an opinion about you from what you have typed. You turn it on. It stays on until you turn it off, including after closing and reopening the app.
- **Nothing is hidden from Quietkeep itself.** Everything you have is still held, still on its surface, still exactly where it was — this changes what the screen shows, not what the app is keeping. The full list, the search and the ⓘ are all still there.
- Nothing counts how often you use it, and nothing is recorded about it beyond the fact that it is on.

## 1.35.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-07*

- **Finishing something no longer hands you the next thing immediately.** Quietkeep now settles: it says what you finished, tells you nothing else is being asked, and waits. The next thing arrives when you press *What is next* — not before.
- **Why that matters more than it sounds.** Whatever is in front of you in the second after you finish something is what your head attaches to finishing things. What used to be there was the most pressing thing left, arriving instantly — so completing one thing quietly signed you up for the next, with no gap at all.
- **Nothing congratulates you and nothing counts.** No “well done”, no “one less thing”, no number. It says what happened and stops.
- **It is not on a timer.** It stays settled until you ask for the next thing. A pause that runs out is the app deciding when you have had enough of a rest.
- **And there is now a way to stop that is not finishing something.** *That is enough for now* reaches the same settled state without doing anything at all. Until now “Not this” only swapped one thing for another, so the only clean way out of that screen was to complete something — which means the screen had chosen for you.
- Nothing is recorded about stopping. Not that you did, not when, not how often.
- **Also fixed:** the line under the offer still said “Fewer things” on a heavy day. That stopped being true yesterday, when a low day started changing *which* things are offered instead of how many. It now says what actually happens — easier things first, just as many.
- **And the “Written this afternoon” line on a sorting card stopped flickering.** It was being blanked every time anything else on the screen updated, and only came back a moment later once it had been looked up again.

## 1.34.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-07*

- **A low day no longer means Quietkeep offers you less.** It used to quietly drop from two things to one when you said you were on a low stretch, or when you had a lot on. It now offers the same number of things and changes *which* ones.
- **A shorter list was the wrong answer, and not a small wrong.** Being handed less on a bad day is the app saying you can manage less today — and for some people, on some kinds of bad day, being offered less is exactly the thing that makes the day worse rather than better. Offering the same amount, but easier, is right either way.
- **So you can now say how heavy something is.** Light, ordinary, or heavy — on any item, three words and no number. On a low stretch the lighter things come forward; on a better day a heavier one is allowed to lead.
- **Nothing is worked out behind your back.** Quietkeep will not guess how hard something is from how long it has been sitting there or how often you have passed it over. Only you can say, and if you have not said anything it is treated as ordinary — never as either extreme.
- **Nothing is hidden either.** A heavy thing on a low day moves later in the order, not out of it — it is still there behind “Not this”. And a real date that has arrived still leads whatever kind of day it is, because that is a promise to somebody else.
- Nothing counts these, and there is no score anywhere.

## 1.33.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-07*

- **You can put a whole place down in one act.** Pick a range — everything under a project, everything matching a word — and *Put them down*. Thirty things stop coming back to you in one decision instead of thirty.
- **The place itself is not taken with them.** Putting down what is inside something is not a decision about the thing that holds it, and Quietkeep will not make that one for you.
- **Nothing is swept without you saying so.** Putting one thing down still never touches what is inside it. This is the opposite case: you named the batch, you said it out loud, and it does exactly that and nothing more.
- **It says what it will do before it does it**, and the sentence names both halves: they stop coming back, and they are not finished and not binned.
- **One Undo brings the whole batch back.** Nothing is shed on the way down, so the way back returns everything it took — which is not true of sending a batch to your wishes, and that receipt has always said so.
- Search still finds any of them by name afterwards, exactly as it does for one.
- **Also fixed: Undo after “Give them a new date” did nothing.** It shipped yesterday and it was broken — the button worked, said “0 things restored”, and put nothing back. Every date it had retired stayed retired. It now restores all of them, exactly as they were.

## 1.32.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-07*

- **You can put something down now.** It is not done and it is not binned — it simply stops coming back to you. There is a new control on any item: *Put it down*.
- **This is the thing Quietkeep did not have.** Everything you hold comes back until you finish it or let it go, and for something that mattered once and does not now, both of those are wrong. Ticking it off is a lie. Binning it feels like destroying something you cared about, and it goes into a list you can then go and look at. So it gets carried instead — and the only way out left is deleting the whole app, which is a lot of people’s actual answer.
- **Nothing is asked of you.** No reason, no category, no note. There is nowhere to put one.
- **There is no list of them, and nothing counts them.** A place to look at everything you have put down is just another pile, and the regret it collects is exactly what made getting rid of things feel expensive.
- **It is not lost, and that is the point.** Search finds it again by name whenever you want it, and *Pick it back up* returns it with a date of its own. Knowing you can get it back is what makes putting it down cheap enough to actually do.
- **Putting a place down does not put its contents down.** Everything inside comes back to you on its own rather than vanishing with it. Deciding to stop carrying thirty things is thirty decisions, and the app is not going to make them for you.
- *Nothing about this is congratulated.* No “that’s one less thing”. The record says you put it down, and that is all it says.

## 1.31.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-07*

- **There is now a way through a pile of dates that have gone by, instead of three at a time.** “Needs a new plan” shows three, on purpose — a wall of them is the pile in a different costume. But with sixty-nine of them, three at a time and one decision each is not a way through, and the only bulk route was the one offered after a fortnight away. If you never went away, there was no route at all.
- Sorting now offers **“Dates that have gone by”** as a batch, and it leads the list when it holds anything. It reads the same thing “Needs a new plan” reads, so the two can never disagree about what is asking.
- **And a new verb: give them all a new date.** Sending a batch to your wishes and letting a batch go were already there; this is the one most of a backlog actually needs — the thing is still worth doing and only the date was wrong. Every date that had gone by on each item is retired, which is what makes it a decision rather than a second date sitting on top of the first.
- **Undo puts the old dates back, exactly as they were**, including a date you had promised somebody else. It is only offered where a date has actually gone by; something still ahead of you is left alone.
- **You can pass over a card in “Needs a new plan” now.** It was the only surface left with no way past: the worst one sat at the top every time you opened the app, and the sole way to be rid of it was to make a decision about it.
- “Not this one” brings the next one forward and moves that one to the back. **Nothing is recorded** — no list of what you passed over, no count, and it is all back the next time you open the app. The number above stays the true total; a number that shrank as you passed things over would be the app keeping score of what you avoided.

## 1.30.3 — ITERATION

*2026-08-07*

- **Sending something to your wishes now says that its date is coming off — and Undo puts the date back.** Nothing on your list of wishes is allowed to be making a demand, so a date genuinely cannot go there with it. That was happening silently, and worse, *Undo* handed you the item back without the date. An undo that returns less than it took is not an undo.
- It now tells you before it happens, in the words of the thing that is actually going: “Its date comes off — nothing on your wishes makes a demand. Undo puts it back.” And it does put it back, with the date exactly as you set it.
- **The question “when should this place come back to you?” no longer disappears when you sort the next thing.** Filing something into a new place offers you that date on the receipt — and it is the only place in the app to answer it. Sorting one more card wiped the offer, and the receipt went on saying “no return date yet” for good, with nothing left to press.
- The way to take back the last thing you sorted still goes when you sort the next one, because it is about *that* action. A question about a place is not about that action, and it stays until you answer it.

## 1.30.2 — ITERATION

*2026-08-07*

- **Filing something into a place no longer throws away its dates.** Putting “renew the insurance” into a place deleted its due date and, worse, deleted the date you had promised somebody else — both silently, in the same moment you filed it. Nothing told you, and nothing anywhere would have shown you it had gone.
- **Filing says where a thing lives. It was never meant to say when.** The place answers *when* for everything that has no date of its own, which is nearly everything. Something that already has a real date says when by itself, and it keeps saying it.
- The one thing filing still clears is Quietkeep’s own bookkeeping — the same-day reminder it adds so nothing can go quiet while you are deciding. Keeping that as well as the place’s would leave a thing filed and still pestering you tomorrow.
- This applies whether you file into a place that already exists or one you name on the spot. They were the same act with two different answers, decided by whether the folder happened to exist yet.

## 1.30.1 — ITERATION

*2026-08-07*

- **Coming back after a while away: “put all of this down” now actually puts all of it down.** It was one act covering everything at once — and if a single item among them was the wrong shape, the whole thing was refused and *nothing* moved. Three ordinary items and one that had a date you owed somebody moved none of the four.
- You would have seen a button that did nothing, with no explanation, at the exact moment there is least patience left for that.
- **Two things were wrong with it.** An item whose date was a promise to someone else kept that date, so it came straight back the next moment. And an item still carrying any other date reached the list of wishes still owing it — which the app rightly refuses, because nothing on that list is allowed to be making a demand.
- Both are fixed, and it now reads from the same place the one-at-a-time surface does, so the two can no longer disagree about what is being asked of you.
- *Unchanged, and still the point:* it marks nothing done and deletes nothing. Everything lands on your list of wishes, where it makes no demand, and you can bring any of it back.

## 1.30.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-07*

- **Something can now wait for another thing to be finished, instead of for a date.** On any item there is a new question — *“Does something have to happen first?”* — and a list to pick that thing from. Until it is done, this one stays completely out of your way. The moment it is done, this one comes straight back, and it tells you which thing it was waiting for.
- **This is what a date could never do.** Strip the sealant, let the frame dry, re-seal the frame: there are no real dates in that. Inventing three guesses so the app has somewhere to put them makes three small promises that were never true, and then tells you off when they pass. There was nowhere else for an order of doing things to live, so it lived in your head — which is the job Quietkeep is meant to take off you.
- **It is not a date and it sets no date.** Writing one will never put something in front of you and will never make something go quiet.
- **If you let go of the thing it was waiting for, this comes back to you — it does not disappear with it.** A whole sequence comes back, not just the step that pointed at the one you binned. Nothing gets stranded behind something that is never going to happen.
- **If you had parked it until a particular day, that still stands.** Finishing the earlier thing early does not drag a parked item forward. You said not yet, and that holds.
- It refuses anything that could not work: waiting for itself, waiting for something already done, waiting for a person or a wish — neither is ever “finished” — and any loop, however long, where two things would each be waiting for the other.
- You can stop waiting at any time, and then it is an ordinary item again, back with you.
- *Still true and worth knowing:* nothing here counts your chains, scores them, or works out when they will finish.

## 1.29.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-07*

- **You can now say when or where you mean to do something — and Quietkeep hands it back to you at the moment it offers you the thing.** There is a new box on every item: *“When or where do you mean to do this?”* Write “after I put the kettle on”, or “next time I’m at the desk”, or “only if Sam has replied”. Whatever you write comes back word for word above the item when it comes up.
- A date is the hardest possible thing to notice — you have to be looking at a clock, and thinking about this, at the same moment. Something you already do every day is far easier to catch. That is the whole reason the box is there.
- It is optional and always was. Nothing asks you for one, nothing counts how many you have written, nothing marks an item as incomplete without one, and nothing ever asks whether it worked.
- **It is not corrected.** The app does not require the word “when”, does not rewrite what you typed into a tidier sentence, and does not refuse a fragment. What you wrote is what you meant, and it is what you get back.
- Writing one sets no date and makes no demand. It will not put an item in front of you, and it will not make one go quiet. It only rides along.
- To remove one, clear the box and press *Keep that*.
- *Still to come in this run of work:* an item that waits for another item to be finished, rather than for a date.

## 1.28.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-07*

- **When an area or a goal comes round, Quietkeep now offers you something to actually do inside it.** Before today it put the area itself in your list, said what it was holding, and then answered “what now” with nothing — a thing was ready and the one surface that tells you what to pick stayed silent. It now offers the work underneath, and says which one asked: “Home came round.”
- It only does this when nothing else is asking. An area with two hundred things under it will never dump two hundred things in front of you; the moment anything is genuinely due, the area waits its turn.
- You are never handed the area itself. Areas and goals are places to look from, not things to tick off.
- **Something you said “not now” to comes back on its day again.** A declined request or a parked worry with a return date had been reaching that date and then just sitting in *Later*, reading “back now”, where nothing would draw your eye to it. It now moves up into what is back — quietly. It is still never put at the top of your work, because you already said no to it once.
- **The line above your list has stopped counting at you.** It used to open with how many things you were holding — a number that only ever goes up, and the first thing you saw. It now says the thing that is actually the promise: **nothing here has gone quiet.** How many, and when each one comes back, is one tap away in the list it opens — where you asked for it.
- If anything ever *does* go quiet, that line says so first and says how many. A promise with an exception you cannot see is not a promise.

## 1.27.1 — ITERATION

*2026-08-07*

- **Asking this browser to keep your writing is reachable again — and if you ever skipped the welcome, it was not.** Skipping it (or pressing Escape) quietly marked the storage question as already answered, without ever showing it to you. The only place left to ask was a button folded inside “Your data”, so the app could go on running with your writing marked disposable and nothing anywhere offering to fix it.
- The explanation and the button now appear together at the top of the ⓘ panel whenever this browser has not agreed to keep your writing, and they go away for good once it has. Nothing pops up on its own.
- **Why it works this way** — the page explaining the research behind Quietkeep — was unreadable. Every wrapped point had been broken in half, with the second half stranded underneath as its own paragraph, and some formatting marks were showing as text. It reads properly now.
- **Sending something to your calendar no longer promises more than it can.** It used to say the calendar “will remind you at 9am on the day”. Nobody has yet watched an alarm actually arrive with Quietkeep closed, so it now tells you what is in the file — a 9am alarm for that day — and leaves the ringing to your calendar, which is the thing that does it.
- *Still true, and still worth knowing:* Quietkeep never sends notifications, and your calendar is the only thing that can reach you when the app is shut.

## 1.27.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-06*

- **When a place comes back to you, it now tells you what is in it.** “Holding the tap washers, the shed key and 4 more.” Until today it came back saying “7 under it”, which is a number — and a number is not a reminder of what you put there.
- The first few by name, then how many more. Never the whole list: a place arriving with everything you filed in it would just be the pile again, on a schedule.
- It says this only when the place has actually come round. Everywhere else it stays an ordinary row — your list is not a filing cabinet diagram.
- Things you have finished are not listed. A place coming round is about what is still in it.

## 1.26.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-06*

- **A place you file things into can now be given a return date — and until today it could not, which meant it never came back.** When you file something into a place, the receipt has always told you honestly: “no return date yet”. That was true and there was nothing you could do about it, so the place sat holding your things and never asked for you again. Everything filed was safe and invisible, which is the exact problem filing was meant to solve.
- **The answer is now on the receipt itself.** “Bring it back on…” — pick a day, and the place comes back to you on it, carrying what you put in it. The sentence updates to say when.
- It is offered, never required. Filing without a date is still a complete act, and the receipt will go on telling you the truth about it.
- A place comes back to be looked in, not to be finished. It is never marked done and never turns into something late.
- *Still missing:* what a place shows you when it does come round is still just the place — a view of what is inside it comes next.

## 1.25.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-06*

- **You can pass over a card now.** Sorting things out asked you to answer, and if you could not, that was the end of the road — and because the queue is oldest-first, the same card was waiting at the top the next time you opened the app, and the time after that. There is a **Not this one** on both passes: it moves on, and it records nothing at all.
- **Nothing is kept about it.** Not what you passed over, not how many times, not for how long. It is remembered only until you close the app, and the count still says what is in your inbox rather than what you skipped.
- When you have been past everything once, it comes back round to the top rather than showing you an empty inbox. Nothing is ever hidden from you — it was passed over, not put away.
- *Still missing, and unchanged:* a place you make on the spot has no return date until you set one, and there is still no control on the receipt to set it.

## 1.24.1 — ITERATION

*2026-08-05*

- **A paragraph of the app’s own source code was showing at the bottom of every screen.** A note meant for whoever writes this thing had escaped into the page, under the Accessibility link, and it had been there for several releases. It is gone, and the walk now checks every screen for anything like it before a release can go out.
- **“Give it a date” was a huge empty box on a phone.** The date field was being stretched to about an inch and a half tall by a layout rule that was correct on a wide screen and wrong on a narrow one. It is the size of a date field again.
- **Tapping the version number now opens the report, instead of just opening this panel.** It said it would open the diagnostic and then left you looking at a menu with the right button somewhere below the fold.
- **This panel now looks like it scrolls.** There is a lot below the fold here — the storage question, your copies, bringing one back, the whole record — and nothing showed that it kept going.
- **The report no longer contradicts itself.** It listed how many clocks were in use and then said hundreds of things had no clock. It meant things with no repeating rhythm, and now says so.
- *Still missing, and unchanged:* a place you make on the spot has no return date until you set one, and there is still no control on the receipt to set it.

## 1.24.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-05*

- **When the one thing on screen is too big to begin, you can now break a bit off it without going anywhere.** Type a first physical action into the line under Next up — “open the file and write one line” — and the card holds it. It has its own Done, and finishing it brings the invitation back for the next bit.
- **That first step never takes a date of its own and never comes back at you on its own.** It rides along with the thing it belongs to. Naming a smaller start should not hand you one more thing that is now late.
- **And when a thing is not too big but too heavy, you can say so from the same place.** “This one is heavy” opens the weights box with that item already attached, so what you write down says what it is about — and the app asks less of you while you are carrying it, as it always has.
- It never guesses that something is heavy. Nothing here is inferred from how long you have had it or how often you have skipped it; weight exists because you said so.
- *Still missing, and unchanged:* a place you make on the spot has no return date until you set one, and there is still no control on the receipt to set it.

## 1.23.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-05*

- **Sorting things out now tells you when you wrote each one.** “Written yesterday evening”, “Written Monday morning”, “Written on 14 Jul”. What a note meant when you scribbled it fades in hours, and by the time it reaches you here it can read like somebody else wrote it — this is the missing half of the message. It never says how old anything is and never counts the days.
- **Next up now says what a thing holds up.** If you have told Quietkeep that one thing feeds another — and roughly how long it takes — the card says so: “it feeds ‘Roster’ — start it within 4 days”. That arithmetic has always been there and you had to go looking for it, which is no use for the thing it is meant to help with. It is on the card now.
- Where the dates do not fit, it says that plainly instead: “to make that date it needed starting 2 days ago.” That is a fact about the dates, not about you, and it is fixable by moving either end.
- *Still missing, and unchanged:* a place you make on the spot has no return date until you set one, and there is still no control on the receipt to set it.

## 1.22.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-05*

- **A clock you can switch on, at the top of every screen.** A real clock face, and beside it how much of today is left — “5h 12m left today”. The remainder is the point: a day you can watch going is a day you can work with, and a day that only announces itself when it has run out is not. Turn it on in this panel, under Extras.
- It also says how many things carry today’s date. A number, not a list — the header is not another place to be given work. It is off unless you ask for it, and nothing about it is counted or kept.
- **What it will not do:** count down to an appointment. Quietkeep records days, not times of day, so it does not know that anything happens at nine o’clock, and it will not make a number up. For something that rings while the app is shut, send today to your calendar — that file carries a real alarm and your device does the rest.
- *Still missing, and unchanged:* a place you make on the spot has no return date until you set one, and there is still no control on the receipt to set it.

## 1.21.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-05*

- **Some things are supposed to happen without you — and nothing tells you when one of them quietly stops.** A delivery that reorders itself, a service on a schedule, a renewal: the work was done once, when you set it up. If it lapses, there is no reminder and no error. The first sign is running out. Anything that repeats can now be marked as running itself, and instead of asking whether you did it, it asks when you last confirmed it is still arranged.
- **Where it depends on somebody else, it says so.** Some of these you cannot check from here — an approval, an authorisation, a supplier who will not write to tell you they have stopped. Marking that changes the words, because "check this" is no use when checking means asking someone.
- It never invents a schedule. Something with no rhythm of its own stays quiet rather than being given one.
- *Still missing, and unchanged from the last release:* a place you make on the spot has no return date until you set one, and there is still no control on the receipt to set it.

## 1.20.2 — ITERATION

*2026-08-05*

- **When an update will not go on, the app now says so instead of looking broken.** Some devices will not let a new version take over while the app is still open. Pressing *Install it now* used to reload into the same version — nothing visibly changed, so the only thing left to try was pressing it again. It now tells you what is actually happening and that closing the app completely and opening it again will finish the job.
- The new version is downloaded before any of this, so closing the app costs nothing and needs no connection.
- *Still true, and worth knowing:* this improvement can only reach you after one more update, and on those devices that update still needs the app closed fully. After that the message is there when it is needed.

## 1.20.1 — ITERATION

*2026-08-05*

- **These notes are written for you, not about how the app gets made.** Two older entries had drifted into talking about who reported a fault and when, which tells you nothing about what you can now see or do. They say what changed instead.
- *Still missing, and named here because it was promised in the last release:* a place you make on the spot has no return date until you set one, and there is still no control on the receipt to set it. Until there is, that place will not come back on its own.

## 1.20.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-04*

- **Everything offered now says where it sits.** The suggestion, the list behind it, and the upkeep chips carry a place line — “in Errands · under Home” — so what surfaces is never just a task out of nowhere.
- **Filing gives you a receipt.** “Filed under Errands — it comes round Thursday”, or, honestly, “no return date yet.” That second one matters: a place made on the spot has no return date until you give it one, and the receipt is where you find that out — the control to set it is the next release.

## 1.19.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-04*

- **Triage can now answer “where”, and make the place if it is not there yet.** Every choice it offered was about *when* — today, tomorrow, someday, gone. So a backlog could be sorted by urgency and never actually filed, and the only thing it could tell you afterwards was a category. There is a **Put it somewhere** choice now: pick a place, or name one on the spot and it is made for you.
- What you file stops asking on its own. The place carries the clock, so the place comes back and brings its contents with it — and *Undo* takes it back out of the place, not just off the list.

## 1.18.4 — ITERATION

*2026-08-04*

- **If you drive this app by voice, several controls would not answer to what is written on them.** The ⓘ button announced itself as a sentence while showing a single letter; “Work on this” answered only to the thing’s title; the two ways out of the ⓘ panel were both called “Close”, as were three different “Set” buttons. Saying what you can see now works, and no two controls on a screen answer to one name.

## 1.18.3 — ITERATION

*2026-08-04*

- **The report now says what has actually come round again** — how many things are asking, and how long they have been waiting, in the same gentle words the app already uses. It used to count the clocks that exist, which is a different number and never the one that explains a day that ended early.

## 1.18.2 — ITERATION

*2026-08-04*

- **Opening Quietkeep for the first time no longer greets you with “a newer version is ready”.** It was announcing your first install as an update, thirty seconds after you arrived. It now says nothing until there is genuinely something newer than what you are already using.

## 1.18.1 — ITERATION

*2026-08-04*

- **An update no longer arrives without asking.** A new version used to take over the moment it downloaded, underneath whatever you had open. Now it waits and says so, what you are using stays whole, and it lands when you press Install it now. Declining costs nothing.
- **The report says more about this device:** which address it came from, whether a version is waiting, and whether more than one copy of the app is here — the sign of an update that did not finish tidying up. “Devices seen in the log” is now “Stores”, because it always counted one per site and per browser rather than one per machine.
- *Still true:* if you are on 1.18.0 now, this one update still lands on its own — the version that asks first is the one arriving. Every update after it asks.

## 1.18.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-03*

- **If something goes wrong, Quietkeep can now tell you what it knows.** Under “If something is wrong” in the ⓘ panel, it writes out a report you can read, copy or save: what it is holding, what state this device is in, and anything it can see that looks wrong.
- **It contains nothing you wrote** — no titles, no names, no notes, no journal text, only counts. That is checked on every build, by generating the report over two planners that hold the same shapes under completely different names and requiring the two reports to come out identical.
- The build number at the bottom of the screen opens it. Nothing is ever sent anywhere on its own; you read it first, and you decide.
- **Also: what Quietkeep is NOT** now sits beside what it is — it is not a medical or therapeutic tool, it does not score you, and it cannot reach you on its own.

## 1.17.4 — ITERATION

*2026-08-03*

- **The rest of the seam audit’s findings, checked and fixed.** Last release fixed the fourteen findings that had been independently verified; this one takes the sixteen that had not, verifies each against the code while fixing it, and pins each fix with its own test. One claim did not fully hold and is recorded as refuted rather than quietly dropped.
- **Un-ticking something brings back what it knew.** Marking a declined thing done, then un-marking it, used to lose the record that you had declined it — permanently. The record survives now: done hides it everywhere, undone brings it back everywhere.
- **Numbers say what they count.** The clear-out confirmation now says its count includes people, weights and private entries — so it can sit beside the gauge’s narrower “Things held” without the two looking like a mistake. The Menu’s count is now the sum of its rows, an import summary counts joined notes the way they actually arrive, and “1 days” reads “1 day” wherever it could appear.
- **Dates from another year say which year.** The declined list, the named-period line and the journal all showed “5 Sep” for a September years away or years ago; they now follow the same rule as the todo list.
- **Duplicates: folding a declined thing into a wish works now** — the picker was refusing a fold the app itself would accept — and a few payloads the app records were declared wrongly in the schema and are now declared as what has always actually been written. Nothing about your data changed.

## 1.17.3 — ITERATION

*2026-08-03*

- **The seam audit’s findings, fixed.** Six independent passes over the places where two parts of the app must agree found thirty-one; the top fourteen were each put to adversarial verification and every one survived. All fourteen are fixed here, each pinned by its own test.
- **A worry is no longer offered as work.** It showed up on the work surface with a Done button before its own flow asked “whose is this?”, and a declined one sat under “Ready now” for ever. A worry stays in its flow now; a declined one rests under Later, as designed.
- **Your calendar gets no nags.** A declined thing exported as an all-day event with a morning alarm — the exact nag the Not Now ledger removes, rebuilt in the diary you trust. Declines and worries no longer export, and the stated count matches the file.
- **Private things stay private, and lists agree.** The status report itemised journal entries as “New — (untitled)”; the printed card offered lapsed items the screen shows only as decisions; the duplicate picker offered journal entries and named periods as things to fold work into, which hid the work from every list. All closed.
- **“Keep it after all” on a settled weight works** — it used to say “Kept.” and keep nothing — and one deeper repair underneath: a settle was the one write that could leak into live state even when its batch was refused. The import panel’s words now name both of its doors truthfully. Seventeen smaller findings are recorded and queued; none loses data.

## 1.17.2 — ITERATION

*2026-08-03*

- **The sheet no longer offers what the app will refuse.** Opening a person, a named period, a weight, a private entry, or a wish taken off the Menu no longer shows date, “not before”, or repeat controls — none of those things can carry a date, and until now the controls were shown and the tap was refused afterwards. “Put it in today” is likewise no longer offered on a named period or a journal entry.
- **This was the fourth of the same defect**, after private entries showing in the coverage list and people sitting in the todo list — a kind of thing appearing somewhere it does not belong. So the fix comes with the thing that was missing: a written table of which kinds belong on which of the sixteen list surfaces, with a reason for each, checked on every build over the set-of-everything. The next one of these fails a named check before it ships instead of waiting for someone to notice.
- No new features in this one, on purpose. The rough edges are the work: each one closed, and each one held closed by a check so it cannot come back quietly. More of the same kind is on the way.

## 1.17.1 — ITERATION

*2026-08-03*

- **Every screen redraws about four times faster.** Nothing looks different — it is the same screens, sooner. On a store of around 560 things, one redraw went from roughly a tenth of a second to about two hundredths.
- The cause was small and silly: working out what calendar day an instant falls on is expensive, and Quietkeep was working out the SAME day — today — thousands of times in a single redraw, from scratch each time. It remembers now.
- **This was a guess until last release.** The estimate had been sitting in the notes for months with nobody able to check it, because there was no store big enough to time. The set-of-everything added last release is what made the number real, and the number was worse than the guess.
- There is now a check on every build that catches this coming back — the writing side has had one for a long time; the reading side never did.
- The measurement that actually counts is still on the iPad, not on a build machine. This makes the shape right; the device gets the final word.

## 1.17.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-03*

- **A report can now cover “since the last staff call” instead of a date.** Under “Telling someone where things are” you can name a period — whatever sets your rhythm — say when it came round, and have the report cover the time since then.
- Naming one asks nothing of you. It takes no date, it never comes back at you, it is on no list, and Quietkeep does not count how often you mark it or notice when you do not.
- **A correction, and it has been there from the beginning: everyone you had named was sitting in your list of things to do.** Not a bug that appeared — people have been rows among your work since people existed here, with nothing to do about them. They have had a page of their own since a while back, which is where they belong. They are off the list.
- That is the same fix as the one two releases ago that took private journal entries out of the same list, and it was one line this time because of it.
- The report’s idea of “since when” also got safer across two devices. If a second device hands over work dated before your last meeting that this one had never seen, it now counts as news rather than being quietly treated as already told.

## 1.16.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-03*

- **There is a way to see how Quietkeep behaves with a whole life in it.** In the ⓘ panel, under “A whole invented life”, Quietkeep now makes a file of several hundred invented things — jobs with steps under them, dates that have gone by, people you are waiting on, duplicates folded together, things you let go, weights, a sealed journal. Something of every kind it can hold.
- **It does not touch what is on this device.** It makes a file and stops. The file only becomes real work if you bring it back in — and doing that replaces everything here, the way bringing any copy back does. So take a copy of your own first and bring that one back when you have finished looking.
- An empty planner is easy to judge kindly. A full one is where you find out whether a screen still reads properly with three hundred things behind it.
- **The reason this exists is a number.** The small sample set was written a long time ago and contains eight of the seventy kinds of thing Quietkeep records. Everything built since — folding duplicates, decisions, the things-you-said-no-to list, what you let go, weights, the journal — had never once been seen with anything in it.
- So from now on, a new kind of thing has to appear in that set, or the build says so and stops. And every screen is now run over the full set on every build, checking for the small wrong things a person should never have to notice: a blank where a name should be, a date that is not a date, a count that does not match its own list.
- Nothing on your screens changed in this one.

## 1.15.1 — ITERATION

*2026-08-02*

- **“Held” now means the same thing everywhere it is said.** Tap the line that reads “N held” and you get that claim itemised. The number and the list had drifted apart, and the list was the half that was wrong.
- **Your journal entries were being listed there, one row each, as “(untitled) — held”.** A journal entry has no title on purpose — that is what keeps it private — so every entry you had written showed up as a blank row in the middle of your work. Nothing readable was ever shown, and the entries themselves were never at risk. They simply had no business being on that list, and they are off it.
- Weights were in there too, listed among the things being covered. A weight is not work, which is the whole point of being able to say one.
- **The number will be smaller next time you open it**, by however many journal entries and weights you are carrying. Nothing has been let go and nothing is hidden — it is the same claim, told accurately.
- The last note said the count of what is covered would not move when you named a weight. Half of that was wrong: the list did not move, and the number did. It does not now.
- The check that is supposed to catch exactly this had been passing because the walk never had a journal entry or a weight in it at the moment it looked. It does now, both.

## 1.15.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-02*

- **You can tell Quietkeep what is on you, and it will ask less of you.** Under the box, beside “Something on your mind”, there is now “Something weighing on you?” — say how things are in one of four words, and name anything sitting on you and how heavy it is.
- **None of it becomes a task.** A weight takes no date, appears on no list, and never comes back at you. It cannot: the app refuses to put a clock on one. Saying it is the whole act, and there is nothing to do about it afterwards.
- **While you are carrying enough, Next up offers fewer things** — never fewer than one, and never anything hidden. What you are holding, and the count of what is covered, do not move at all. Only what the app puts in front of you gets shorter, which is the point.
- **One small thing changes nothing.** A single pebble is meant to be sayable without consequence — if noting it made the app behave differently, you would stop noting them.
- When it does ask for less, it says so in one line, and that line never tells you why you are how you are. It states two things that are true at the same time. Quietkeep does not diagnose you and has nowhere to store an opinion about you.
- The thing you wanted from the Menu still rides along on a heavy day. That is deliberate: it owes you nothing, and it is often the most appropriate thing there.
- “Settled” takes a weight off. What you wrote is kept in the record like everything else you have ever told it, and the thing itself joins what you have let go, where you can still take it back.

## 1.14.2 — ITERATION

*2026-08-02*

- **Nothing changes on screen in this one.** It is a check on Quietkeep’s own record-keeping, and it is here because the same mistake happened twice in one day.
- Quietkeep keeps a fixed list of the kinds of thing it can record — every event it knows how to write down. Twice now, something on that list turned out to be written by nothing at all, so a feature the list insisted existed simply did not. Neither showed up as a fault, because a note nobody writes breaks nothing; it just quietly is not there.
- **Every entry on that list now has to account for itself.** Either the app really writes it, or the record says in plain words that it does not and why — reserved, waiting on a decision, or replaced by something else. Twenty-three entries were silent; all twenty-three now say which. The check runs on every build, and it catches a note that has gone out of date too.

## 1.14.1 — ITERATION

*2026-08-02*

- **Opening Quietkeep no longer rebuilds everything from the beginning.** Every launch, every reload, it replayed your whole history from the first thing you ever put in — and that got a little slower with every day you used it. It now keeps a photograph of where things stand and reads only what has happened since.
- The photograph is written after the app is already on screen, and only when enough has happened to be worth it. It can never be in the way of putting something down.
- **Nothing about your history changes.** The record is still every single thing you ever wrote. The app checks the photograph against that record on every start, and if the two ever disagreed it would throw the photograph away and read the record instead.
- How much faster this makes it on your iPad has not been measured. This removes a known reason for it to be slow; it does not come with a number.

## 1.14.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-02*

- **The panel now tells you when a copy of your data last left this device.** It is a date, beside the line about whether the browser is keeping your data — and when something has happened since, it says so in one sentence. Quietkeep has always recorded every copy you took; nothing ever read that record back to you.
- **And an empty Quietkeep now offers you the way back.** A new device, or a browser whose website data has been cleared, opens to an empty screen — which is exactly the moment you need the copy in your Files, and exactly the moment nothing was pointing at it. One button takes you straight to the file picker.
- **The panel is straighter about what “keeping your data” covers.** It means the browser will not clear it on its own to make room. It has never meant your data survives you clearing the browser’s website data yourself — that takes Quietkeep with it, and the file you exported is what comes through.
- The walkthrough says the same thing on the way in, so it is something you know on day one rather than on the day it matters.
- None of this nags. There is no automatic backup, no reminder, no badge, and no count of how far behind you are — when the copy is current it says nothing at all.

## 1.13.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-02*

- **The journal.** Somewhere to write that is not a list and asks nothing of you. It is in the ⓘ panel under Your data, and it starts by asking you to choose a passphrase.
- **Your entries are scrambled with that passphrase, and Quietkeep cannot read them.** Not while the journal is closed, not in a backup, not in anything it syncs through. That is not a promise about good behaviour — the words genuinely are not there to be read.
- **Which means a forgotten passphrase cannot be recovered, by you or by anyone.** It says so plainly before you set one, because that is the moment it matters rather than something to find out later. Everything else you keep here is untouched by it.
- **Nothing you write is ever counted, searched, or brought back at you.** A journal entry appears on no list, is offered as no next thing, and has no date. It is not work, and the app treats it as though it is not.
- Closing the journal, or simply reloading, shuts it again. There is no setting to leave it open.
- Two things this deliberately does NOT do yet: the passphrase cannot be changed — that would mean re-scrambling every entry — and there are no tags. Both are better absent than half-built.

## 1.12.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-02*

- **A person now has a page of their own.** Tap somebody’s name anywhere it appears on an item and you land on them: what they owe you, how long it has been, and everywhere else they come up. Every line is a door back to the thing itself.
- **Names on an item were not tappable before.** They were plain text — so the one question a name raises, *what else is with them?*, could be asked nowhere. They are buttons now.
- **It keeps score on nobody.** A person’s page states durations and relationships and nothing else: no ranking, no comparison between people, and none of the words this app refuses. How long something has been with someone is a fact about a date.
- Quietkeep could already work all of this out — it simply had nowhere to say it. The answer existed and no screen asked for it.

## 1.11.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-02*

- **Next up offers a few things you could pick up, rather than a queue.** It used to show one thing, then five more beneath it, then “8 things are asking”. That last line was a count of everything waiting, sitting on the first screen you see — which is the one thing this app is not supposed to put in front of you.
- **What is offered now is a small set chosen to be different from each other.** One thing with a real date and one thing that has been quiet for a month are easy to choose between, because you are picking what you feel like, not weighing two similar jobs. Two near-identical next actions are the hard case, and they can no longer appear together.
- **The one it leads with has not changed.** A real date arriving today still comes first, and the app still answers “if you only do one thing”. Nothing about what outranks what has moved.
- **And something you wanted comes along.** One thing off your Menu rides with the offer, saying plainly that it is something you wanted rather than something asking. It carries no date and no Done — picking it up is still a decision you make on its own page, never something that crept up on you.
- **No number.** The offer no longer says how much is waiting. What you are holding is still stated honestly, in the line just above it that has always carried it — once, in the place that exists to say it.

## 1.10.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-02*

- **The timer is something you commit to now, not something you are held to.** It used to count down — “two minutes: 1:47 left” — and then ask whether you had finished. That is a deadline, and a deadline on a thing you are already avoiding makes it harder to start, which is the opposite of what it was for. The point of two minutes was always that it is a *cheap* decision.
- **So it shows only that it is running.** A quiet mark, and the time you chose said in words. No numbers counting down, and no circle or bar filling up either — a shape that is part-way full is a way of saying you stopped short, and that is a score about you. There is nothing to leave unfinished.
- **You choose how long.** Two, five, ten, twenty or thirty minutes, set in the ⓘ panel under Extras — calmly, not in the moment you are trying to start something. Two minutes stays the default, because it is the one nobody has to think about. The button then names the time it will actually start.
- **Stopping records nothing.** Quietkeep used to write down that a timer had been given up on. Nobody ever saw the word, but it was kept and it went into your exports — and a record of the times you did not finish your own work is exactly the thing this app is not supposed to keep. It now keeps only that a timer ran, the way it already does for focus sessions.
- **And when the time is up, the timer just goes.** It does not ask you anything. The thing is still there, still waiting for today, whenever you want it.

## 1.9.2 — ITERATION

*2026-08-01*

- **Fixed: folding a duplicate quietly took things with it.** When you folded one thing into another, what had been *decided* about the folded one — and the record that you had *declined* it — stopped appearing anywhere: not on the surviving thing’s sheet, not in the Not Now ledger, not in your status report. **Nothing was ever deleted.** Those records were kept the whole time and simply had nowhere to show. Both are visible again: the thing that stays now shows what was decided about either of them, and something you declined and later folded keeps its place in the ledger, saying where it lives now.
- **A fold also used to go quiet on you.** If you declined something and it was parked until later, folding it into work you *were* carrying handed that work the silence without the reason — it just stopped appearing, with nothing to explain why. It does not do that any more. An ordinary “come back to this on Thursday” still comes across, as it should.
- **And a fold now brings across what the folded thing fed.** “Start this by Tuesday, because the launch waits on it” used to disappear when you folded a duplicate — in both directions. It comes across now, along with the thing’s rhythm, who is running it, what is put by for it, who it is with, and its place in today if it had one. Where something cannot come across — because it would have meant two things each waiting for the other — it says so instead of dropping it.
- **Folding is only offered where it can land.** Something carrying a date is no longer offered a wish or a someday item as the thing that stays; that used to fail *after* you had chosen. Two wishes still fold together, which is the commonest pair there is.
- **And the way back is reachable however deep it goes.** If you folded A into B and later folded B into C, A’s “split it back out” had nowhere to be reached from. It is on the sheet now.
- **Fixed: “Clear what I am holding” would not run at all if you had folded a duplicate.** Not slowly, not partly — it refused, every time, for anyone who had folded two things together and left them folded. It has been like that since folding arrived, and nothing in this app’s own checks had ever tried the two together. It works now, and the thing you folded away is let go with the rest of it.
- Under the surface: the checks that guard all of this were rebuilt so this cannot happen again. Every piece of information a thing holds must now say, in writing, what a fold does with it — and the app will not build until it does. Two of this app’s own tests had quietly stopped covering what their names promised, and both were widened; one of them found the clearing bug above within minutes of being widened.

## 1.9.1 — ITERATION

*2026-08-01*

- Nothing changes on screen in this one. It makes three checks real that this app had only ever *claimed* — the kind of gap that is invisible until the day it matters, which is exactly when you would least want to find it.
- **The list of things that can be stored is now checked against the document that defines it.** Every event this app can write has to be named in its written vocabulary, and every name in that vocabulary has to exist in the code — including whether each one can leave something of yours without a way back. That was true of the running app and unverified against the document; now the build fails if they ever disagree.
- **Every write to your data is now accounted for.** The rule was always that writes go through the boundary that refuses to leave anything of yours unreachable. Five places legitimately write around it — snapshots, importing, clearing, and two bookkeeping notes — and each of those now has to say in writing why it is safe. A sixth appearing without that argument fails the build.
- Also corrected: several notes in this repo’s own records that had quietly gone out of date, including two that contradicted each other about whether a screen feature exists. They describe what is actually built now.

## 1.9.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-01*

- **A project can say who cares how it goes.** You have been able to mark someone as “they care about it” for a long time, and nothing ever showed it back to you. Now they have their own place on the thing’s own sheet, and the list of what you are carrying names them — so “who do I tell when this moves” has an answer you can read instead of remember. Anyone you marked before is already there; nothing needs re-entering. They are people to tell, never people who owe you anything.
- **What was decided, kept where the work is.** A meeting’s real product is decisions, and they had nowhere to go. Any project or area now carries a decision log on its own sheet: write the decision, log it, and it stays — newest first, with the day. It cannot be edited or deleted, and that is the point: if a decision changes, you log the new one, which is what a decision log is for.
- **Your status report says what was decided.** The report you hand to somebody now carries a “Decided” section covering the period it reports on — only what is new since the last one, like every other part of it.
- **Fixed: the report had a section that could never appear.** “Started” was listed in the report’s own structure and nothing could ever fill it. It is gone rather than invented: this app has no half-done state on purpose, and a heading that exists to be filled would have made “started and not finished” something a reader could work out about you. A new check makes it impossible for a section like that to be added again.

## 1.8.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-01*

- **“Not mine to carry” — and the decision is kept.** Anything someone asked of you can be declined from its own sheet. Declining is a decision, not a deletion: it lands in the Not Now ledger, behind the ⓘ under Your data, with the words it was declined under, who asked, and the day — the thing to point at when the same request comes back. “Carry it after all” is one tap behind it, any time.
- **Nothing chases you.** A declined thing is parked, not deleted and not nagging: it sits quietly, comes back only where parked things already do, and the ledger keeps a name and a date — never a count. There is no “declined three times”. There never will be.
- **A day for requests.** Under Extras, choose a weekday and requests can wait for it: anything someone asks of you can be parked to your day from its own sheet — so it is dealt with when you decide, not the moment it lands. Declining sends things to the same day. No day chosen, nothing changes.
- **Letting a worry go now keeps the decision too.** The bother flow’s “Not mine to carry” used to promise the thing would never come back — by quietly trashing it. It now lands in the ledger like any decline, parked and silent. The relief is the same; the record is finally honest.
- Also: importing from another planner now says how many things repeat on a rhythm — rhythms are not carried, and rebuilding the real ones as upkeep should start from the true number, not from a tag name.

## 1.7.2 — ITERATION

*2026-08-01*

- **The ⓘ panel folds.** Its four big areas — Help, Your data, Extras, About — sit behind their own headers now, closed until you open them, and the panel remembers which you keep open on this device. Everything is still there; you just no longer stand in front of all of it at once.
- **Quietkeep Sync now says so.** If you are in the Sync edition, the top of the panel and the walkthrough say “Quietkeep Sync”, and every sentence about where your writing lives states that edition’s truth — sealed on your device before anything leaves, a key only your devices hold — instead of the standalone edition’s “there is no server”, which was a lie there.
- **“Planning for Humans” actually opens now.** Tapping it used to land you back on the main screen: the offline machinery answered every slow page request with the app itself, and could even overwrite its stored copy of the app with the essay. Both fixed — and the page’s own styling now survives the app’s strict security rules, so it reads as intended.
- **Buttons that open a list now say when they will close it.** “Read the record” becomes “Close the record” while the record is open, and the same for “Things you let go”.

## 1.7.1 — ITERATION

*2026-08-01*

- **“What’s new” prints properly now.** Bold is bold and quotation marks are quotation marks — the raw codes that were showing on this very list are gone.
- **The stray lines in the ⓘ panel are gone.** A status line only draws its separator when it has something to say, so each section holds together instead of being cut apart by rules that meant nothing.
- **The small print reads as small print.** The caveat under each control is set in italics now — the same honest words, in a quieter posture, so the panel skims by heading and button and the detail is there when you want it.
- The walkthrough’s last step now names the button that is actually on it — “Get started” — and says plainly what it does: it opens the ⓘ panel so keeping your data safe is the first thing you do.
- In the ⓘ panel, the number on the app icon has its own heading now, and the calendar’s “it is a snapshot” caveat sits with the calendar again — it is about the copy you sent, and it read as if it were about the icon.

## 1.7.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-01*

- **The same thing twice? Fold it into one.** When two entries are really one worry — seven years of inbox will do that — open either one and fold it into the other. Its dates, note, people, and anything under it go along; nothing is swallowed, and the one that stays keeps its own words wherever both spoke. The sheet of the one that stays lists what folded into it, and “Split it back out” undoes the fold any time — a promise that outlives the sitting, not just the undo bar.
- **“Sharing a name with something else”** joins the sorting batches: everything whose name exactly matches another thing you hold, oldest first, so twins meet each other on the conveyor. Only exact matches — the app never guesses that two things that merely sound alike are the same.
- **A lens for looking at one part of your life.** When you have places like Home or Work, a small “Looking at” chooser sits above your held list: pick one and the list shows only what lives under it. Everything else is still held, still clocked, and still comes back — the lens changes what you see, never what Quietkeep holds, and it says so right there every time it is on. Next up, the gauge, search, and dates that come back are never narrowed: those speak for the whole of what you hold, always.

## 1.6.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-01*

- **“How it hangs together” — the whole shape, when you ask for it.** A tap opens the tree: every area, goal, and project with what sits under it, indented. It is a way of seeing, not a place to work — a row opens the thing itself, big branches say truthfully how much more they hold, and it never becomes the front page.
- **Every list is a door now.** The “also asking” rows under Next up, every row of “What you are holding”, and the things listed under a project on its sheet — all open the thing itself with a tap. Nothing on screen is words you can only look at.
- **Review finishes its four questions.** Alongside stalled projects and orphaned items, it now notices a goal nothing is feeding, and an area holding work where nothing has finished in a month — said calmly, three at a time, with the true count. Rest is legitimate; the question is only whether it is rest.
- **A quiet close to a working session.** Finishing or stopping now ends on what was true: what happened to the thing you were on, and that everything you hold is covered — in words. No timer totals, no score. And if a thread from earlier is still waiting, it asks the one question: have a look, or let it go.
- **Composing your day — optional, and off until you ask.** Turn it on under Extras and anything you hold can be chosen for today from its own sheet, up to five, sitting quietly above Next up. At midnight the choosing simply lapses — nothing counts what was chosen and not done, and the app never picks for you. Turn it off and it is gone.

## 1.5.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-01*

- **Act on a whole batch at once.** Inside “Sort things out”, any batch now takes wholesale acts: file them all under a place, send them all to the Menu, park them all until a day, or let them all go. You see the exact sentence of what will happen — counted from the real changes, including anything that cannot take the act and why — before anything is written, and one tap takes the whole act back.
- **Nothing is ever swallowed on the way.** Sending dated things to the Menu sheds their dates visibly, letting things go saves a copy of everything first — before anything is touched, checked by machine — and the record explains every wholesale act in one line: what you did, to how many, in the very words you agreed to.
- **Fixed: “You can still keep it after all” is now always true.** Letting something go used to be final the moment its sheet closed — the button that promised a way back was unreachable. “Things you let go”, behind the ⓘ panel, now lists everything you let go, newest first; open one and keep it after all. It is recovery, not an archive: nothing there nags, decays, or counts.
- **Wishes get their own wholesale door.** Batches like “On the Menu — read” appear in the picker now, offering exactly what a wish can take: bring them all back as real work, or let them go. No dates, no filing — a wish holds no demands.
- Also: “Export a copy of these” on any batch — a reading copy of those things and their history, honestly named as not-a-backup (the whole-store export remains the real one).

## 1.4.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-08-01*

- **Notes on things.** Anything you hold can now carry words — details, links, half-thoughts — edited on its own sheet and shown only there, so lists stay one calm line each. Clearing the box removes the note, and that is recorded honestly too.
- **Imports bring their notes along.** A file from another planner now arrives with every note attached to its item, and the summary says how many came — the loss this app once inflicted silently, then admitted, is now simply over.
- **“What happened to this” — every item can explain itself.** Open anything and unfold its history: when it arrived, where you sent it, what date it was given, and every time the app stepped in — each of the app’s own moves saying why (“so it would not go silent”). The permanent answer to “where did it go?”.
- **You can read the record itself.** Behind the ⓘ panel: the append-only record everything is worked out from, every line in plain words, newest day first, with its true size stated. Reading changes nothing, and no line ever shows a note’s or journal’s contents — it says one was written, not what it said.
- Also: an item’s sheet now quietly says how it was sorted (“sorted as reference”), and typing a year below 1000 anywhere no longer lands you in the wrong millennium.

## 1.3.1 — ITERATION

*2026-07-31*

- **Fixed: sending a dated thing to Someday no longer swallows the date.** A due date, a “not before”, or a parked return date on something you shelve to the Menu is now cleared as part of the same act — visibly, in the record — instead of riding along invisibly where no screen could ever show it again. The app now refuses outright to leave a Menu item carrying a date, however the attempt is made.
- **Fixed: sorting cannot act on a card that just changed.** If the thing on screen was completed, shelved, or let go while you had it open — the sheet is one tap away — tapping a route now says so and shows the fresh card, instead of quietly filing a decision you had just contradicted.
- **“Leave it” always moves on.** When everything left in a batch has been left once, the round starts over instead of showing the same card again while claiming it was left — and with one card remaining, it says exactly that.
- **Two dates on one day tell the truth.** Something due the same day it opens now reads as the obligation it is, not as “not before” — a deadline is the louder fact.
- Also: a place created mid-filing can no longer collide with an existing project’s name whatever screen it is on; estimates and date fields stay hidden on Menu items where they could never mean anything; keyboard focus lands somewhere real after every sorting action; a typed year below 1000 stays the year you typed; and the machinery that checks every write got a set of stricter refusals with the tests to hold them there.

## 1.3.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-31*

- **“Sort things out” — a triage that can finally reach everything.** Pick a batch in your own words — the loose things a big import brought in, everything under one project, whatever matches a word — and work through it one card at a time with the same six choices triage has always had. Nothing gets rendered as a wall, there is no countdown and no score, and leaving is always one tap that records nothing. The batch is simply smaller when you come back.
- **Tap any triage card to open it.** Renaming, a real date, filing it somewhere, naming who it is with — all reachable mid-sort now, on both triage surfaces, without losing your place.
- **“Not before” — the date that opens instead of asking.** Give something a day and it stays out of the way until then, comes back ready on its own, and nothing happens if the day passes — a door opening, not a deadline. Defer dates imported from another planner finally show up here too, editable at last.
- **Filing got fast.** The “what is this part of” list narrows as you type, each place says where it sits, and typing a place that does not exist yet offers to create the project and file under it in one go.
- Also: an optional “about how long?” minutes note on anything (kept for a future version that learns how long things really take — nothing checks up on it), and the machinery underneath got two orders of magnitude faster at taking in large batches, which the coming wholesale actions will stand on.

## 1.2.3 — ITERATION

*2026-07-31*

- **Fixed: naming who is running a tracked project now actually shows their name.** Saying “they are running it” on a project recorded the person but the carrying report went on saying “nobody named yet” forever. The names you already entered come back on their own — nothing to redo.
- **The import summary now tells you about notes.** Notes are not carried across yet, and the summary used to imply a file had none when it was full of them. It now says how many notes were in the file and that they do not come across — plainly, before anything is written. Carrying them in is on the roadmap.
- And the app does less invisible work: a long list it builds behind a closed panel is now built only when you open it, which keeps big planners quick.

## 1.2.2 — ITERATION

*2026-07-31*

- **Things you are holding now say where they sit.** An item that belongs to a project shows “in ⟨project⟩” right on its row, and a project shows how many things are under it. Before, an imported action that already had a home looked exactly like a loose one — so a big import (say, from OmniFocus) arrived as one flat pile with no way to tell what was already filed from what still needs sorting. Now the loose ones are the ones with nothing beside them, which is what makes a backlog possible to work through.

## 1.2.1 — ITERATION

*2026-07-31*

- **Sending something to “Do now” no longer feels like a trap.** The offer that follows now says which thing it is asking about by name, and adds “Leave it for now” — so you can agree it is for today without being made to either mark it done or start a timer. It stays on your list under Next up either way.
- **The “also asking” list under Next up reads as a list again.** Each thing is on its own line with its name in full, above a quiet note of why — instead of name and note run together on one line, which read like a paragraph rather than a set of separate things.

## 1.2.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-31*

- **Undo, for when a card moves and you want it back.** Triage is meant to be quick — one tap and the card is gone — but quick can feel like lost. Now, right after you sort a card, it says where it went and offers to take it back. One tap returns it to your inbox, exactly as it was, whichever way you had sent it.
- **Search: find anything you are holding.** Type a word and everything that matches is there, each one saying where it is now, and tapping it opens it. It only searches what you are actively holding, it never changes anything, and it keeps no record of what you looked for.

## 1.1.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-31*

- **A short walkthrough the first time you open Quietkeep.** Four calm steps on what it is and how it works — put something down, it sorts and times itself, it is all on your device. You can Skip at any point, and it never interrupts again.
- Want it back? “Show the walkthrough again” is under the ⓘ, beside how to use the app.
- **A Help section under the ⓘ** — short, tap-to-open answers to the things people ask: getting a thought out of your head, what happens after, how it picks what is next, dates that have gone by, reminders, privacy, backups, and two devices.
- And, for the curious, “Why does it work this way?” opens the full reasoning behind Quietkeep — a readable page right here in the app on how memory, attention and motivation actually work, with every source named and tagged by how well established it is.

## 1.0.1 — ITERATION

*2026-07-31*

- **The ⓘ panel now opens with what Quietkeep is, how to use it, and how to add it to your home screen** — not with the storage details. The first thing you see is the app explaining itself, and the install steps are there for iPhone, iPad, Android and computer.
- Everything else in the panel is grouped into named areas — your data, extras, and about — instead of one long run of tools, and it points back to the rest of the free apps at noahjefferson.pages.dev.

## 1.0.0 — VERSION

*2026-07-31*

- **This is version one.** Every capability the planner was built to have is in place and in daily use — friction-free capture, triage, a single Next-up, dates and repeats, the Review that surfaces only what has stalled, the person lens, the carrying report, and calendar reminders. Nothing here is a preview any more.
- It stays exactly what it always was: yours, on your device, with no account, no telemetry, and no server holding your data. Keeping two devices in step is a separate edition you opt into; the planner itself still cannot reach anything at all.

## 0.27.3 — ITERATION

*2026-07-31*

- **Two devices now catch up on their own — no need to press Sync.** While a device is open it quietly keeps in step with the other, and it checks the moment you switch to it. Before, a full catch-up could take a few taps of “Sync now” because each tap did only one leg of the back-and-forth; now opening both is enough.
- A single “Sync now” also finishes the whole exchange in one go, rather than one step of it, and tells you the total it moved.

## 0.27.2 — ITERATION

*2026-07-31*

- **Fixed: work synced from your other device now appears straight away.** When a device received a planner from its pair, the items landed but the screen could stay blank until you closed the app and reopened it — which looked exactly like sync doing nothing. Now the moment anything arrives, what you are looking at updates to show it, with no restart.

## 0.27.1 — ITERATION

*2026-07-30*

- **Dropping a device now actually clears its access.** “Replace the key” used to stop only new work from reaching a device you let go; the last few weeks already waiting at the handover point could still be collected. Now, if this device is online, it empties that too — and says plainly when it could not, so you are never told a device is cut off when it is not.
- **A page you can open to see the handover point’s health.** If your other device is not catching up, you can now check in plain words whether the handover point is up, and what a hold-up most likely means — it is almost always a daily limit that resets on its own, with nothing lost.
- **Taking a key in now carries a warning, where before only giving one out did.** A key someone hands you lets them read this planner, so the app now says so at the moment you paste or open one, and tells you to check the pairing name against your other device’s screen.
- Several places where the app described its own safety more confidently than it should have are now corrected to say exactly what is and is not protected — what leaves the device, what a handover point can tell, and what replacing a key can and cannot undo.
- Fixed: a device whose key was replaced could stay quiet until you next wrote something, instead of bringing a fresh device fully up to date straight away.

## 0.27.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-30*

- **Two devices can keep each other up to date — in a separate app called Quietkeep Sync.** Pair them once, and from then on each brings the other up to date when you open it. No account, nothing to sign in to.
- Pairing shows a code and a key. Scan the code with your other device, or paste the key into it — nothing is written to a file unless you ask for one, so there is no copy of it left in a downloads folder afterwards.
- You can see which devices have written here, and when each one last did. If you want to drop one, replacing the key stops it receiving anything from this device from that moment on — though whatever it already holds, it keeps.
- Your writing is sealed on your device before any of it leaves, with a key only your devices hold. The handover point in between stores something it cannot read and is never given the key.
- Both devices show the same short pairing name. If one shows something different they are not a pair — worth being able to see, rather than working it out from the fact that nothing ever arrives.
- **Quietkeep itself still cannot reach anything at all, and that does not change.** It is the more private of the two and stays the one you get by default; the browser refuses to let it contact anything, whatever it is asked to do. Moving your work across is an export and an import, once.
- Taking in another device’s work only ever adds. It never replaces and never removes, so neither side can lose anything to the other.

## 0.26.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-30*

- **When a newer version is ready, it says so and offers you a copy first.** A line above the app, not something over it, with “Save a copy”, “Reload now” and “Not now”. Ignore it and nothing changes.
- It does not pretend anything is at risk, because nothing is — this app only ever adds to its record and an update cannot rewrite it. A copy is a point to come back to, and that is all it claims to be.
- It appears once. Declining is an answer, not a question to ask again.

## 0.25.1 — ITERATION

*2026-07-30*

- **“Ready now” means somebody set a date.** A thousand things you had never dated were being counted as ready today, and the number on the icon said so. What the app puts on something to make sure it comes back is not a date you chose, and it no longer pretends to be.
- **When nothing is asking, it says what is actually going on** — how many things are here without a date, waiting on you to decide — instead of the section quietly vanishing.
- A card you were interrupted in the middle of now carries its own return, so it is offered back whatever else changes.

## 0.25.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-30*

- **A date that already went by in your old planner does not arrive as something asking today.** Importing a long-running planner used to turn years of passed dates into that many things needing a new plan on the morning of the import. They come in without a date instead, and the app tells you how many and why before you press anything.
- **No heading shows more than 25 things at once.** It says exactly how many it is holding back, and one tap shows them. A list of a thousand rows is the pile in a new coat.
- Anything already finished in the other planner arrives finished.

## 0.24.1 — ITERATION

*2026-07-30*

- **Buttons stay with the thing they belong to.** On a long title, “Done” used to wrap onto a line of its own and sit directly above the *next* item — so it looked like it belonged to that one instead. The box is now drawn around the whole row, including its buttons, at every width and text size.
- A gate now measures this, so it cannot come back quietly.

## 0.24.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-30*

- **The number on the app icon is optional.** One button in here turns it off, and it goes off straight away rather than at the next reload. Nothing is lost — the app still holds everything and still tells you inside.
- **You can bring work in from another planner.** An OmniFocus export — TaskPaper or CSV — or anything else TaskPaper-shaped. Projects keep their contents, and dates you set over there arrive as dates you set here, so they are the sort a calendar can carry.
- It reads the file and tells you what it found *before* anything is written, including what will not come with it: flags, contexts, estimates and repeats stay behind, because this app has no priority field on purpose.
- It goes in beside whatever is already there. Saving a copy and starting again from empty first is one section down, if you want a clean run.

## 0.23.2 — ITERATION

*2026-07-30*

- **Your calendar only gets days you chose.** It was also being offered every date Quietkeep sets for itself — the “back with you tomorrow” it puts on anything you route — so routing nine things in one afternoon offered nine all-day events on a single day, with alarms, none of which you had dated. Those stay here now, where they belong.
- If nothing has a date you set, it says so and says why, instead of looking broken.
- **The number on the app icon is findable.** It is how many things are ready now, it is stated beside what you are holding in the same words, and the panel explains it. Before, it was a number that appeared nowhere inside the app.

## 0.23.1 — ITERATION

*2026-07-30*

- **The build number is on the main screen now,** at the bottom, small. It was only inside this panel’s title, so a screenshot of the app could not say which build it was — which is exactly how you end up looking for something your device does not have yet.

## 0.23.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-30*

- **You can clear things out, two different ways.** *Clear what I’m holding* empties your surfaces and keeps every record of what happened, so a copy you export afterwards still has all of it. *Start again from empty* replaces the lot, history included, and cannot be undone from inside the app. The panel says which is which before you choose.
- **Neither can be done by accident.** Each asks you to type a short word first — a different word for each, so a word typed for one can never authorise the other — and switching between them clears what you typed.
- **It recommends saving a copy, with the button right there,** and the sentence above the go-ahead says plainly whether you have saved one.
- It tells you the real count of what is about to go, never a rounded one.

## 0.22.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-30*

- **You can put some sample work in.** An empty planner is hard to judge, so there is now a button that adds a small set of ordinary work dated around today — a job with two steps, something whose date has already gone by, something you are waiting on someone else for, a couple of things nobody is asking of you, and two notes not yet sorted. It goes in beside anything you already have and behaves exactly like your own work.
- There is no button that takes only the sample work back out again, and the panel says so before you press it.
- **Files you export now carry your own date, not the world’s.** In the evening an exported calendar was named with tomorrow’s date while saying inside that it was made today. Same day in both places now.

## 0.21.1 — ITERATION

*2026-07-29*

- **The X on the (i) panel stays where you can reach it.** It was pinned to the top of the panel, and on the iPad it scrolled away with everything else — so both ways out ended up at the very top and the very bottom of a panel thousands of pixels long. It no longer moves at all, because it is no longer inside the part that scrolls.
- **And the panel is not thousands of pixels long any more.** It was showing every release note ever written, all at once. Now it shows what changed this time, with everything older one tap away.
- Escape closes it too, on a keyboard.
- This one had come back after being fixed once. It is held by a check now.

## 0.21.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-29*

- Today, on one page. The thing to do next, what else is ready, what is with other people, and what is coming up — for a meeting where a screen is rude, or a day the battery is going to lose.
- It says on the page that it is a snapshot, and that ticking something off on paper does not reach Quietkeep. Paper cannot update, and you should not have to remember that at four in the afternoon.
- It is one page on purpose. What it leaves off, it counts — "and 34 more" — so you always know what is not in your hand.
- **And "Print it" now prints the right thing.** It used to hand your printer the whole app: the panel you pressed it in, everything behind that panel, and the page layout doing its best. The button worked and what came out was unusable. Fixed for the status report as well.

## 0.20.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-29*

- You can now put down something that is on your mind but **is not a task** — "the thing with the roof" — without first inventing a next step for it. Being made to write a worry as a task is how you end up with steps you will never do, on a list you are supposed to trust.
- **The first question is whose it is, not what you are going to do about it.** Asking for a next action first is what makes people make one up.
- Three answers: mine to do something about, mine to keep an eye on, or **not mine to carry**.
- "Not mine to carry" is a real answer and it is honoured completely. It is let go, it is not parked, and **it does not come back "just to check"**. An app that quietly re-raises what you released is one that did not believe you.
- "Mine to do something about" sends it to your inbox, and only then are you asked what the actual next step is.
- "Mine to keep an eye on" parks it and brings it back in a week. Nothing to do in the meantime, and nothing carried in your head either.
- One at a time. It says how many are there and shows you exactly one — a list of worries is a worse thing to look at than any single worry on it.
- Nothing here calls it a problem, or you a worrier, and letting something go gets the plainest sentence in the app rather than a congratulation.

## 0.19.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-29*

- The Menu is a place now, not just a heading. Things you have put there are grouped by what they are for — Read, Try, Go, Make, Look into, Save for — instead of sitting in one undifferentiated pile.
- **It is behind a button and it is closed when you arrive.** A list of things you want that greets you every morning is a list of things you owe. The button says how many, and says plainly that none of them are asking.
- A category you have nothing in is not shown. An empty "Go" is not a gap to fill; it is a thing you have not wished for.
- Something you are saving for can now hold two numbers: what it costs and what you have put by. "£120 put by of £300. £180 to go."
- **There is no bar, no percentage, and no date worked out from how fast you are saving.** A bar is a machine for implying you are behind, and this is the one part of Quietkeep that structurally cannot ask you for anything.
- Both numbers are yours to set and either can be left empty. Clearing one unsays it rather than recording that something costs nothing.
- Nothing on the Menu carries a clock, and putting a number on a wish does not turn it into a deadline.

## 0.18.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-29*

- Come back after a week or more away and Quietkeep says so plainly — how long you were gone, and that everything you put down is still here. That is the whole greeting. It does not present you with a bill.
- **It cannot show you the pile.** Not after a fortnight, not after a year, not with a thousand things waiting. What you get is one thing to do next, at most three to sort, and the count — and there is no setting, no length of absence and no amount of work that changes that.
- It says how many are waiting and then says "a few at a time". A number is a fact; a list is a demand.
- If dates went by while you were away, you can move them all to the Menu in one go. **Nothing is deleted and nothing is marked done** — everything is still there and you can bring any of it back whenever you want.
- What that actually removes is not the work. It is the twenty separate decisions standing between you and being able to start, which is the real cost of coming back.
- You can decline and take them one at a time instead. Saying no is not recorded as anything.
- Nothing here says you are behind, and nothing apologises on your behalf. Being away is not something that happened to your list — it is something you did, and it was allowed.

## 0.17.1 — ITERATION

*2026-07-29*

- "Worth a look" was staying quiet about a stalled piece of work when the only thing left under it was the leftovers of a finished focus session. That is exactly the failure it exists to catch, and it was hidden by residue.
- A status report could be made to say "Nothing to report." when there was plenty to report — anything you had written down on more than one line could break the shape of the document. It is a page you hand to another person, so it now says only what is true.
- Work brought in from your other device is now included in the next report. It was being left out for being older than your last one, even though you had never seen it and had certainly never told anyone about it.
- Somebody you have let go is no longer named as running something. It was still showing their name, confidently, which is worse than showing none.

## 0.17.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-29*

- Messages arrive all day and attention does not divide. If you want it, Quietkeep now offers a single pass through them **at the moment you come out of working on something** — when looking costs least.
- **Never while you are in the middle of anything.** A prompt that can turn up at any moment is a notification wearing different clothes, and it would be the exact interruption this is meant to replace.
- It is off unless you ask for it, in the (i) panel. A planner that arrives having decided you should check your messages twice a day has made a decision about your working life it was not asked to make.
- Saying "not now" writes nothing at all. Not a record, not a mark, nothing — it comes round again exactly as if it had never asked.
- It counts nothing. Quietkeep cannot see your messages and never will, and there is no number here for anyone to feel bad about.
- Turning it on does not immediately interrupt you for having turned it on. The rhythm starts from that moment.

## 0.16.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-29*

- Some work you do; some work you **carry**. Open anything you have made bigger than one step and say "someone else is doing this", and it moves to a new "Carrying" — who is running it, when you owe an answer, and what is outstanding.
- **Quietkeep stops offering you their work.** Nothing under something you are only carrying will be handed to you as your next step. It stays on your list, because it is still real — it just stops being your job.
- Nothing is graded. No "at risk", no amber, no colour that means anything about how someone else is getting on. It states who and when and lets you decide, because it does not have the evidence to do anything else.
- You can now say when you owe somebody an answer, and that date behaves like any other — when it goes by it asks you what to do about it rather than sitting there.
- And there is now a report. What has changed since the last time you told anyone — finished, come back, now with someone else — plus what is still outstanding and what is coming up.
- Copy it, save it as Markdown, save it as a spreadsheet, or print it. Nothing is sent anywhere; it is written for you to hand over yourself.
- It is worked out from your own history, so **nothing has to be kept up to date for it to be right**. There is no second list to maintain and no chance of the two disagreeing.
- The next report starts where the last one ended. It will not tell you the same thing twice.
- If your browser will not let Quietkeep use the clipboard, it shows you the text instead of losing it with an apology.

## 0.15.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-29*

- Quietkeep can now answer "what am I waiting on Sam for". A new "With other people" shows everything that is with someone else, longest-waiting first — the one worth mentioning when you next see them.
- **Things nobody has named show up too.** Sending something to "Waiting for" is one tap and never asks who, so most of what you are owed has no name on it. A list that quietly left those out would be worse than wrong, because you would trust it.
- You can put a name to something whenever you like, in its own sheet, and say how they are involved — they owe you it, they asked for it, they are running it, they care about it, or they just came up.
- Nobody has to be named. Ever. A thing you are owed works exactly the same without one.
- It says how long, in plain words — "with Sam for three weeks". That is a fact about a date and nothing more. Nothing here says anyone is late, and nothing counts how many times you have asked.
- When it arrives, say so. It comes off what you are owed and stays on your list, because a thing arriving is not a thing finished — it is usually the moment the actual work becomes possible.
- Typing "sam" when you already have a "Sam" links to the Sam you have. One person, one place, however you type it.

## 0.14.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-29*

- You can now work on one thing. Tap "Work on this" and Quietkeep holds that one item in front of you, says how long you have been at it, and gets out of the way.
- When something else comes up, put it down without stopping. It goes into your inbox like anything else and you carry on — no dialog, no decision, no losing your place.
- **Your way back is saved the moment you write the interruption down**, not when you stop tidily. Close the app, get called away, let the battery die — come back and it still knows where you were. Being pulled away without getting to press a button is the whole reason this exists.
- When you do stop, you can leave yourself five words: "I was about to…". It is optional, saying nothing is completely ordinary, and nothing asks twice.
- What comes back is your own sentence, not the app’s. If you left five words, that is what it says.
- Switching to something else leaves a way back to what you put down. Swapping tasks is the most ordinary thing anyone does and it should not quietly cost you a thread.
- Finishing leaves no way back, because there is nothing to come back to. Nothing offers you a route into work you have already done.
- A thread you let go is let go. The work itself stays exactly where it was — nothing is deleted and nothing is marked done on your behalf.
- Being interrupted is not a failure here. It counts what you wrote down, which is a thing you did, and there is nothing that says you were distracted, late, or off track.

## 0.13.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-29*

- Bigger things can now hold smaller ones. Open anything and say "this is bigger than one step", and it becomes something other work can sit under — the report, and the three things that actually make it happen.
- Nothing is filed away out of reach. Whatever you put under something else is still on your list and still comes back to you on its own. This app does not have a place where things go quiet.
- A new "Worth a look" appears when something is structurally broken — and only then. Most of the time it is not on the page at all, because most of the time nothing is wrong.
- The thing it catches is the expensive one: a bigger piece of work with no actual next step under it. That looks perfectly ordinary everywhere else in the app, and nothing happens for weeks.
- It also catches anything that lost what it belonged to, which can happen when you bring in a copy from another device.
- It shows at most three at a time and says how many there really are. Coming back after a fortnight should not be a wall.
- It is a count, never a score. Nothing here says you are late, and nothing here congratulates you for an empty list — an empty one simply is not there.
- You cannot put a thing inside itself, or inside something already under it. That is refused as you try, and the picker never offers it in the first place.

## 0.12.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-29*

- You can now say that one thing holds up another, and how long it takes — and Quietkeep works out the last day it can start. Six days until the thing you promised, two days of work, so start it within four.
- A date that has gone by now tells you what it cost. Instead of only "that date was two days ago", it says which commitment it fed and that it needed starting two days ago — the part that is genuinely hard to work out in your head.
- Nothing is ever guessed. Without both a date on the other thing and a length on this one, it stays quiet rather than inventing a number.
- When the dates do not fit, it says so about the dates. Not about you — there is no "behind", no "late", and there never will be.
- You cannot make two things each wait for the other. That is refused as you try, because it has no meaning and no fix.
- Finishing or letting go of the thing downstream stops it pulling on anything. A commitment you are no longer under cannot make something else urgent.

## 0.11.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-29*

- Two devices can now carry the same work. Export from one, and on the other choose "Take in what I don’t have" — anything the copy has and this device doesn’t is added, and nothing here is removed.
- It is opt-in and it is manual: nothing runs on its own and nothing is sent anywhere. There is still no account, no server and no telemetry, and the app is complete without ever using it.
- Taking in the same copy twice costs nothing and says so, because being unsure whether you already did is the ordinary case.
- Letting something go on one device lets it go on both once you have exchanged — this carries decisions across, not just new items.
- Replacing everything is still there, unchanged, for setting a device up again. The two are now separate buttons that say which is which, and the one that cannot lose anything is the one your keyboard lands on.
- If you edit the same thing on both devices before exchanging, the most recent edit wins and the other is quietly dropped. That is a real limit and it is said here rather than hidden.

## 0.10.1 — ITERATION

*2026-07-29*

- A "Do now" thing can now simply be marked done. Before, the only thing on offer was a two-minute timer, so a job you finished in forty seconds stayed on your list until you went looking for it.
- The two-minute timer is now something you choose, not something that starts on you. "Do now" is a category — the timer is a tool, and it is there if you want it.
- When the two minutes are up, Quietkeep asks whether you finished. It used to record that you had, without asking. Time running out is not the same as being done, and saying "not yet" is not a failure.
- The Do now panel no longer disappears when your inbox goes empty. Sorting your last item into it made the whole thing vanish, timer and all.
- The panel has a close button at the top that stays with you as you scroll. Closing it used to mean scrolling past every release note to reach the bottom.
- Sending to your calendar now confirms it where you can see it. The confirmation was appearing above the button, off the top of the screen — so it looked like nothing had happened.
- A damaged or joined-together copy is now refused before anything is replaced, and says what is wrong with it in a sentence.

## 0.10.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-29*

- You can bring a copy back. Quietkeep could hand you everything it held and had no way to read it back, so moving to a new device meant starting again and the exported file was one nothing could open. Choose an export in the panel and it comes back.
- It tells you what is in the file before anything changes — how many things, and when the copy was made — so you can check it against what you remember rather than trusting a filename.
- Bringing a copy back replaces what is on this device. It is never merged, and the app says so plainly before you decide. Saving a copy of what is here now is offered first, and listed first.
- A file that is not a Quietkeep export, or one that has been damaged or cut short, is refused with a reason — and refused before anything of yours is touched.
- The panel and the main screen now count the same way. "Things held" in the panel was counting things you had let go, so it could read one higher than the number on the screen behind it.

## 0.9.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-29*

- A date that has gone by now asks you what to do about it, instead of sitting in the list looking like something you could still get on with today. There is no list of things you did not do in this app, and there never will be.
- Five ways out, all of them forward-facing: do less of it, hand it to someone else, move the date, pick a new one, or decide it is not happening now. Choosing "not now" puts it on the Menu, where nothing is owed — and that is as easy to reach as any of the others.
- Whatever you choose, every date that had gone by goes with it, so the same thing does not come straight back asking again.
- At most three at a time, and it tells you how many there are altogether. Coming back after a fortnight away should not be a wall.
- Something waiting on a new plan is no longer offered as "next up" as well, asking to be done today — that was the one question its date had already ruled out. It still appears in the list of what you are holding, under its own heading, so nothing is hidden.

## 0.8.1 — ITERATION

*2026-07-29*

- The calendar file is now accepted by strict calendar apps. Text pasted from a PDF or a terminal could carry invisible characters that quietly made the file invalid.
- Something parked until a date now goes to your calendar too. The list said "parked until Friday" while the calendar quietly left it out.
- A reminder is never dated in the past, so it can actually go off — previously anything already waiting was sent with a moment that had been and gone.
- The panel no longer shows you a stale answer. Reopening it used to repeat whatever it said last time, however much had changed since.
- After sending to your calendar, the keyboard stays on the button and the result is announced, instead of silently jumping to the top of the page.

## 0.8.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-29*

- Quietkeep can now tell you about something when it is closed. Send what you are holding to your calendar, and the calendar reminds you at 9am on the day — it already runs when this app does not, so you no longer have to remember to open anything.
- Repeating things go across as real repeats, so the calendar keeps asking on its own rather than needing a fresh copy every time.
- It is a snapshot of the moment you send it, and the app says so plainly. Change a date here afterwards and the calendar will not follow — send a fresh copy when it matters.
- Nothing you have finished, and nothing sitting on the Menu, is ever sent as a reminder.
- On devices that support it, the app icon now shows how many things are ready — and only those, so it is a number that can actually reach zero.

## 0.7.2 — ITERATION

*2026-07-29*

- Ticking something off twice by tapping quickly can no longer record it twice.
- After you tick something off, the keyboard stays with your list instead of jumping to the top of the page, and the app now says out loud what you just finished.
- Typing a new name for something is no longer thrown away if you change a date in the same panel before saving it.
- Things on the Menu no longer show a Done button. The Menu is the one place that asks nothing of you, and a row of completion buttons made it look like a list of things owed.

## 0.7.1 — ITERATION

*2026-07-29*

- A card could show one date while being filed under another — it now tells you about whichever date will actually bring it back to you.
- Something far in the future now says which year, so next September and September in ten years no longer look the same.
- Something set aside until a date now says when it comes back, instead of just “held”.
- Renaming refuses a title made only of invisible characters, which used to leave a blank card you could no longer identify, and very long titles are trimmed so one thing cannot bury the rest.

## 0.7.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-29*

- What you are holding is now sorted into plain groups — not sorted yet, ready now, coming up, later, on the Menu, and done — instead of one long list. Nothing is counted or scored; they are just headings, so you can see the shape of it at a glance.
- You can tick something off straight from the list, without opening it first.
- You can fix what you wrote. Open anything and correct the words — useful when a thought went down fast and came out sideways.
- Something you have finished now says so, rather than claiming it is coming back to you today.
- Fixed: after adding something from a link, the items in your list quietly stopped opening when tapped until the next change.

## 0.6.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-29*

- Tap anything you are holding and you can now change it. Until now the app could only take a thought in and sort it once; now it can hold a plan.
- Give something a real date, or take the date off again — if you take it off, it comes back to you today rather than going quiet.
- Make something repeat: how often, and how long it can go before it asks again. A plant and a phone call do not need the same patience, so each thing keeps its own.
- Take back a “done” if you ticked the wrong thing, keep something you had let go, or put it on the Menu where it waits without asking anything of you.

## 0.5.1 — ITERATION

*2026-07-29*

- Fixed a fault that could stop Quietkeep opening at all. If a single date in your data was malformed, the app failed to start and — worse — anything you typed while it was in that state was lost silently. Your writing was always safe on the device; it just could not be reached. It now starts regardless, and refuses to record a broken date in the first place.
- Something you finished can no longer come back as though you had not done it, and an item can no longer get into a state where neither finishing nor dismissing it did anything.
- Work can no longer disappear from the day’s list because it had two dates on it.
- The same thing is never shown to you twice on one screen.
- Tapping to see everything you are holding now lists exactly as many things as the count claims.
- If saving fails, you are told so where you can see it, rather than only being told by a screen reader.
- Finishing the last thing on the list leaves the keyboard somewhere sensible instead of nowhere.
- Areas and goals are no longer offered as though they were a task you could tick off.

## 0.5.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-29*

- Quietkeep now opens with one thing to do, chosen for you, and says why it picked it. Behind it is a short list — never the whole pile.
- “Not this” moves on and keeps no record of it. Skipping something is not held against you, because nothing about it is written down at all.
- Things you do regularly come back on their own rhythm, and each one has its own idea of what “a while” means — the plant and the phone call are not held to the same patience.
- Nothing is ever marked late. When something comes round again it simply says so, and it keeps saying so gently rather than louder.
- Tapping what you are holding now opens the full list, with the day each thing comes back — so the count is something you can check rather than take on trust.
- “Today” now means today where you are. Anything you put down in the evening comes back that same evening, not the following afternoon.

## 0.4.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-28*

- Quietkeep now helps you sort what you have put down. It brings up one thing at a time and asks a single question, so you never face the whole list at once.
- A quick first pass, if you want it: hot or cold — just a feel for what matters, two taps.
- Then a clear choice of where each thing goes: do it now, make it the next step, wait on someone else, keep it for someday, file it as reference, or let it go. Whatever you pick, the thing is looked after — it can never fall silent.
- Choosing “do it now” starts a calm two-minute timer for the small thing in front of you. You can stop it whenever; it is there to help, never to hurry you.

## 0.3.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-28*

- You can now capture into Quietkeep from outside it: share a page or a note to it from any app, add a Capture shortcut to the app icon, or open a link that drops text straight in.
- Anything captured from a link shows a plain confirmation with an Undo, and never runs or trusts what the link contained.
- The app now ships a strict security policy that stops any code it did not author from running.

## 0.2.4 — ITERATION

*2026-07-28*

- The one-time welcome no longer flickers back if you reopen the app right after closing it.

## 0.2.3 — ITERATION

*2026-07-28*

- A held thought is never reported as lost. If anything goes wrong after it is saved, you are told the truth about it, and the thing you typed is never taken from you.
- Holding the same thought twice by tapping quickly can no longer make a duplicate.
- Exporting tells you plainly whether the file was made, and never records a copy that did not leave.
- Opening the app when the network is broken always shows the copy on your device, never an error page.
- Your writing reads correctly whatever your text size, and every control is reachable by keyboard with a clear focus outline.

## 0.2.2 — ITERATION

*2026-07-28*

- The storage details now read correctly to screen readers.

## 0.2.1 — ITERATION

*2026-07-28*

- Opening the app on a slow or stalling connection no longer waits on the network. After two seconds the copy already on your device appears, and any update quietly arrives for next time.
- Holding two thoughts in quick succession can no longer tangle the order they are recorded in.

## 0.2.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-28*

- There is an ⓘ in the corner now. It holds these notes, the storage answer, and what Quietkeep is — and it introduces itself once, the first time you open the app.
- You can export a copy of everything to a file, whenever you like. It is plain text you can read without us, and it is yours.
- Every export is recorded in your own log, so your history also remembers when a copy left.

## 0.1.0 — CAPABILITY

*2026-07-28*

- Quietkeep can hold things now. Type a thought, and it comes back to you — you do not have to remember to look.
- What you type is kept as you type it. If you are interrupted mid-sentence and come back later, it is still there.
- Nothing is saved to a server, because there is no server. Your writing stays on this device.
- You can ask the browser to keep your data rather than treat it as disposable. The Storage panel says plainly whether it agreed.
