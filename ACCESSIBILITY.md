# ACCESSIBILITY.md — Quietkeep

Append-only register. Rows are **never deleted and never silently edited**. A
fixed row keeps its original number and gains a resolution line naming the
release that fixed it. Doctrine §4 governs; this file records how it is applied
here, plus every finding as it is found.

Target: **WCAG 2.2 AA**, with COGA-informed patterns. A published conformance
note ships with v1.

---

## Part 1 — Design-time bindings

Doctrine §4 requires the non-hue channel be **stated before the code is
written**. This section is that statement. It exists before any UI does, on
purpose. Nothing here may be decided later at the keyboard.

### B-01 · Pressure and decay
The single decay primitive `(last_done, comfort_window, rising pressure)` drives
most of what the user sees. Pressure is continuous, and it is carried by **four
redundant channels**, of which hue is the least important:

- ****Position**** — Higher pressure sorts higher in the list. Order alone conveys the ranking.
- ****Fill**** — A horizontal fill bar, 0–100% of the comfort window. Length is readable with no colour perception at all.
- ****Luminance**** — Fill darkens monotonically as pressure rises. Survives a grayscale render — the pass condition, not a nicety.
- ****Text**** — Every item states its own status in words ("ready again", "ready in 3 days").

Hue may reinforce, never carry. **A grayscale render of any pressure surface
must remain fully readable.**

**Corrected 2026-08-01 (1.9.1).** This paragraph used to say "no pressure
surface exists yet (Phase 0/1 ship capture and a flat list)", and that stopped
being true a long time ago: pressure words ship on Next up, on the behind
list, and on the detail sheet. It also contradicted B-05 below, which names a
"pressure gradient" as something that exists. Both cannot be right.

The true position is narrower, and better. Of B-01's four channels, **only
position and text were ever built** — the fill bar and the luminance ramp do
not exist in `app.css`, and no pressure surface carries hue at all. So there
is nothing for a grayscale render to strip, which is why the check still has
nothing to measure. That is a much stronger place to be than the sentence it
replaces implied, and it is stated here so the gap is visible rather than
comfortable: two of the four redundant channels are a design commitment, not a
shipped feature. The day a hue-bearing pressure surface lands, the grayscale
check lands in the same commit (B-08's rule) — and if the fill and luminance
channels are built, they arrive with it.

**No red walls.** Rising pressure never terminates in an alarm colour, because
there is no failure state to alarm about (product law 5). The gradient runs
toward *emphasis*, not toward *danger*.

### B-02 · The coverage gauge
Reads as text first — "everything returns · 0 silent". The number is the
information; any colour is decoration. **Today it is a static `<p>`** that reports
the count; when it gains the expand-to-show-return-dates behaviour it becomes a
real `<button>` with `aria-expanded`, never a bare `<div>` with a click handler.
The interactive form is a design commitment for when the behaviour exists, not a
description of the current element.

### B-03 · Capacity, heat, and magnitude
Three places use small ordinal scales: capacity (low / steady / sharp / unsure),
the heat pass (hot / cold), pebble magnitude (pebble / rock / boulder). All three
are **labelled in words on the control itself** and differentiated by glyph and
size. Colour is never the distinguishing feature. Per LESSONS.md, the accepted
filter-chip pattern is used — **strike-through is banned for off-states**, it
reads as deleted.

### B-04 · Sizing
No fixed size may ignore the space available (Doctrine §4, LESSONS.md §6). Type is
sized in `rem` so the user's *text-size* preference is honoured, not only page
zoom, and content that cannot fit scrolls inside its own container rather than
the page. Both are **enforced today**: `tools/a11y.mjs` asserts zero page
overflow (and zero dialog overflow) at 320px with 200% text, in both themes.

**A floor must never exceed the space available.** The stronger form — every
panel *measuring* the space at the moment it opens, rather than trusting CSS —
is a design commitment for the surfaces that will need it (the sheets and
overlays of later phases); nothing in Phase 1 measures at runtime, and this does
not claim otherwise. The 320px/240px place-card failure in a sibling app is why
the viewport check is a gate and not an intention.

### B-05 · Motion
Reduced-motion is honoured throughout: `app.css` carries a global
`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` block that collapses every animation and
transition, so the honouring is one rule rather than a habit. No animation is
load-bearing for meaning.

**Corrected 2026-08-01 (1.9.1).** This row used to say "the pressure gradient,
the gauge, and the replan card all have static presentations", which named a
pressure gradient B-01 said did not exist. There is no gradient: pressure is
carried by position and words alone (see B-01's correction). The gauge and the
replan card are static, and always were.

### B-06 · Interaction and focus
Keyboard always. `:focus-visible` rings are never removed — the gate Tab-navigates
to every control and measures the ring's style, width and contrast. Touch targets
≥44px tall and ≥24px wide, checked in every rendered state. Real `<dialog>` and
`<button>` elements. Zoom never locked. The 2-second capture budget applies to the
keyboard path too — capture must be reachable without a pointer.

### B-07 · Modes
Dump · Review · Work (and Rest) are modes, and Doctrine §3 requires a mode
announce itself with a standing indicator and an obvious exit, with the current
mode in a live region so a screen-reader user learns of a change without hunting
for it. **No mode exists yet** — Phase 1 is capture only. This is the binding for
when they arrive; the one live region shipped today (`#status`) reports capture
confirmations, not mode.

### B-08 · The contrast gate
Contrast is **computed, never eyeballed** — a CI check that exits non-zero on any
failure, run in both themes. **A new foreground/background pair is added to the
gate in the same commit that introduces it.** No exceptions, including for
disabled states and placeholder text.

Known instrument limitation, inherited from a sibling app: automated audits
silently drop colour-contrast to `incomplete` (not `violations`) for elements
under a CSS transform. Any transformed surface is checked by explicit
measurement, not by trusting the audit's summary. A green axe run over
transformed content proves nothing.

**Stood up for the app 2026-07-28** — until then this section described the
brand-token check only, which was the V-10 shape (a claimed gate that was a
sentence). `tools/a11y.mjs` now audits the **rendered app** in CI: a per-state
selector registry (a selector that stops matching FAILS — silently skipping what
a check cannot find is how gates rot), contrast computed against the resolved
ancestor background in both themes, axe 4.10.2 per state, target sizes, and
B-04's hardest viewport, 320px at 200% text, where the page may not scroll
sideways. Proven to bite both ways before being trusted (§6): a broken `--ink-soft`
produced failures and exit 1, and against the adversarial attack that fooled its
first version (rings/placeholder/targets removed) it produced 23 failures — see
F-02. **Watched green in CI**, per V-10's rule that a gate nobody has watched
pass is a file; the observed run is recorded in NOTES.md's log.

### B-12 · Containment and Review (0.13.0)
Two surfaces added, both audited in the same commit that introduced them.

**Review** (`#review`) carries no colour of its own. Its rows use the same
`--ink`-on-`--bg` and `--ink-soft`-on-`--bg` pairs as every other list in the
app, measured at **13.94:1** and **6.48:1** light, **and its heading at 15.73:1**.
That is the point rather than an economy: this is the surface that tells you
something is structurally wrong, and it must not be the one place the app raises
its voice. There is no alert colour here to check, and the *absence* is the
measurement (law 5, and B-01's rule that nothing rides on hue).

**`#detail-place`** — the line stating what a thing is part of — is `--ink`, not
the quieter `--ink-soft` used for hints. A structural fact is not an aside. It is
registered under its own gate state, `detail sheet, inside something`, because it
renders **only** when the node has a parent; put in the base sheet's registry it
matched nothing and the gate said so, which is the registry rule in B-08 working
rather than a thing to route around. Measured 15.73:1 light, 13.28:1 dark.

**`#detail-parent`** shares `#detail-feeds`' rule exactly, so the sheet's two
structural selects cannot drift into looking like different kinds of control.
Both are `min-height: var(--target)`; targets pass at 44px in both themes.

### B-13 · Focus and the way back (0.14.0)
The focus surface carries no colour of its own and nothing on it counts down.
Elapsed time is stated in the quiet token, the same one every other "when" line
uses — it is a fact, not a pace to keep up with, and there is no threshold at
which it changes appearance. That absence is deliberate and it is the point
(law 5, B-01).

**Two contrast failures the gate caught in this work, both fixed:**
`#focus-cue::placeholder` measured **3.28:1 in dark** on `--ink-soft`/`--surface`.
A placeholder is text someone has to read to know what the box wants, so it is
held to 4.5:1 like any other text — now `--ink` at full opacity, matching
`#capture::placeholder`. Both placeholders are in the registry.

**Two overflow failures at 320px/200%, both fixed:** adding "Work on this" made
`.card` a three-control row that could not wrap (**42px past the edge**), and
once it wrapped the button itself was still wider than the viewport at 200%
(**12px past**). `.card` now wraps; `.card-focus` is `max-width: 100%` with a
wrapping label. Both were found by the gate rather than by looking, and the
overflow check now **names the offending element** — "42px of overflow" said the
page was broken and nothing about where, which cost two hand-written probes.

**`.focus-elapsed` is UNMEASURED, and this is the honest record of it.** The line
renders only after a whole minute has passed (`focusWords` returns null below
that, because "0 minutes so far" is a number pretending to be information), and a
CI walk that sat for sixty seconds in each theme would spend two minutes to
measure a pair that is already measured: `--ink-soft` on `--surface`, identical
to `.review-count` and `.replan-count`, both of which ARE in the registry. That
is an **argument, not a measurement** — the same treatment and the same wording
as `.replan-context`, recorded rather than quietly assumed.

### B-14 · The person lens (0.15.0)
`.people-why` — *"With Sam for three weeks."* — is the lowest-contrast text on
the surface and it is load-bearing: it is the fact you use to decide whether to
mention something. `--ink-soft` on `--bg`, measured in both themes and in the
registry.

**There is no colour that means "they have had this a while", and there will not
be.** Duration is stated in words at one weight, and no threshold changes the
appearance of anything. B-01's rule that nothing rides on hue applies here for a
second reason as well: a colour aimed at how long someone else has taken is this
app passing judgement on a third party, which it does not do (law 5).

The surface deliberately shares `.review`'s shape. Both answer *"what is not
ordinary work right now"*, and two different-looking boxes for the same kind of
answer is a thing to learn rather than a thing to read.

`#detail-person::placeholder` is `--ink` at full opacity, matching every other
placeholder in the app after the 0.14.0 finding — a placeholder is text someone
must read to know what the box wants, so it meets 4.5:1 like any other text.

### B-15 · Carrying, and the report (0.16.0)
`.portfolio-why` is the whole content of a portfolio row — who is running it,
when an answer is owed, what is outstanding — so it is the lowest-contrast
load-bearing text on the surface. `--ink-soft` on `--bg`, in the registry, both
themes.

**There is no colour on this surface that means "at risk", and there will not
be.** A hue aimed at how somebody else's work is going is this app grading a
third party on evidence it does not have. Every status is stated in words at one
weight; no threshold changes the appearance of anything. B-01, and law 5 applied
to someone who never agreed to be measured.

`#detail-track` is **not** in the `detail sheet, carried` registry: once
something is tracked that control is replaced by `#detail-untrack`, which is what
the state actually offers. The gate reported the missing selector rather than
skipping it — the registry rule biting for the third time (`#detail-place`,
`.focus-elapsed`, now this), which is what it is for.

`.report-preview` is `--ink` on `--bg` with `white-space: pre-wrap` and
`overflow-wrap: anywhere`. It renders in two situations: when the clipboard is
refused, and when printing. The first is the one that matters — a permission
failure must put the text in front of the person rather than lose it with an
apology, and it therefore has to be as readable as any other text in the app.

### B-16 · The comms sweep (0.17.0)
`.comms-words` is `--ink`, not the quieter hint token: it is the whole content of
the surface, not an aside. Registered in both themes, along with the two controls
and the opt-in in the panel.

**There is no badge, no count, and no colour on this surface.** An unread count
is the most effective piece of shame-by-arithmetic in software; this app cannot
see your messages and would not report a number if it could. The words are an
offer and a duration, and the test asserts the absence of seven specific
formulations (`unread`, `waiting for you`, `still not`, `inbox zero`, …) plus any
"N messages" pattern.

Accessibility here is mostly a matter of *when* rather than contrast: the chip
renders only on the focus-exit ramp, so it never steals attention or moves focus
during a task. Declining writes nothing, so the surface has no state that
accumulates and nothing that can build up to be faced later.

### B-17 · Coming back (0.18.0)
`.reentry-words` carries full `--ink`, not the hint token: *"You were away a
fortnight. Everything you put down is still here."* is the **content** of this
surface, and the reassurance is the reason it exists. The counts beneath it are
the lesser fact and sit in `--ink-soft`. Both are registered, both themes.

**Nothing here is keyed to how long you were away** — no colour, no threshold, no
emphasis that grows with the number. A lapse is not a severity. This is B-01's
rule about hue, applied to the one surface where a designer's instinct is
strongest to signal urgency, and where doing so would contradict law 8 outright.

The greeting is audited at 320px and 200% text as its own overflow case. It is
the screen somebody meets after a fortnight away, which makes it the one where a
horizontal scrollbar would be least forgivable.

`#reentry-dismiss` moves focus to `#capture`, because the section it lives in
disappears on activation and focus must not fall to `<body>` (WCAG 2.4.3) — the
same fix `clarify.ts` and `work.ts` already carry, applied at the point the
control was written rather than after an audit found it.

### B-18 · The Menu and save-for (0.19.0)
`.menu-money` is `--ink-soft` on `--surface` and is the whole of what a save-for
says. Registered in both themes along with the category headings, the items and
the opening control.

**There is no bar, no percentage, and no colour keyed to the numbers.** The smoke
gate asserts the absence structurally — no `<progress>`, no `role="progressbar"`,
no percentage width in the rendered markup — because this is the one accessibility
question on the surface that a contrast check cannot answer. A progress bar is a
machine for implying you are behind, on the one part of the app that by law 6
cannot ask for anything.

The Menu is **closed on arrival, every time**, and does not remember being open.
That is a COGA decision before it is a preference one: a surface that greets you
with a list of things you wanted is indistinguishable, on a bad morning, from a
list of things you owe.

### B-19 · The bother flow (0.20.0)
`.bother-choice-hint` is the lowest-contrast text on the surface and it is
load-bearing: it states what each answer will DO. A forced choice with unlabelled
consequences is a guess, and this is the one question the whole flow turns on.
Registered in both themes, with the entry line and its placeholder.

**All three choices are styled identically.** "Not mine to carry" is not a lesser
option, is not a destructive-action red, and must not look like either — it is an
ordinary answer with an ordinary appearance, and the visual equality is the
argument. Any future styling that distinguishes it would say something the
product does not.

The three stacked choices, each a label over a hint, are audited at 320px and
200% as their own overflow case — the same treatment as the replan sheet, which
has the same shape and is the wordiest surface in the app.

The entry point is a closed `<details>`. The place you go to name a worry must
not itself be a prompt to find one.

### B-20 · Printing (0.21.0)
**There was no print stylesheet in this repo at all until now**, and 0.16.0
shipped a "Print it" button regardless. `window.print()` against the live page
produced the About dialog, the app behind it, and whatever the screen layout did
under print media. The control was reachable, operable and correctly labelled —
and the artefact it produced was unusable, which no contrast or target check can
see.

Everything printable now renders into `#print-area`, and `@media print` hides
every other child of `<body>`.

**The theme is overridden on purpose, and only here.** Print forces black on
white. A dark theme sent to a printer is a page of toner and an unreadable
result, and the printer is not a device anybody chose a theme for — this is the
one place in the app where the user's stated preference is not the right answer,
and it is stated rather than assumed.

Type is set in `pt` rather than `rem` for print, `@page` carries a 15mm margin,
and `break-inside: avoid` keeps a section off a page boundary. The list marker is
an empty ballot box so the page can be used with a pen — deliberately not a
control that reports anything back, which the honesty line on the card says in
words.

### B-21 · The way out of the (i) panel (0.21.1) — reported twice
**found on device, twice.** The panel's header was `position: sticky` inside the
dialog's own scroll container. That is correct, every engine in CI honours it,
and it did **not** hold on his iPad: the header scrolled away with the content,
so both ways out sat at the extremes of a panel thousands of pixels long.

The dependency was **removed rather than debugged**, because I cannot test the
engine that broke it. `#about[open]` is a flex column that does not scroll;
`.about-body` is the only thing that moves. The header cannot scroll away because
it is not inside the box that scrolls. That needs no support from any engine and
cannot regress on one.

**The close is now wired first, before anything that can fail.** It used to be
attached ~490 lines into `mountAbout`, after the patch notes, storage, import,
comms and report wiring — so every one of those had to succeed for the modal to
be closeable, and `app.ts` swallows a throw from that function silently. A dialog
you cannot leave is the worst failure this panel has available, and it was the
last thing made possible.

**Two bugs were introduced by this fix and caught before shipping**, both worth
recording because both passed a casual look:
- `#about { display: flex }` beats the UA's `dialog:not([open]) { display: none }`
  on specificity, so the panel closed correctly and **stayed on screen** — a worse
  version of the bug being fixed. Caught by asserting `checkVisibility()` after
  the close instead of trusting `close()`.
- `<input type="file">` fires a **bubbling** `cancel` event when its chooser is
  dismissed, so a new Esc handler on the dialog shut the whole panel the moment
  anybody chose a file to import. Caught by the smoke walk within minutes.

Both now have gates: the walk asserts the panel is genuinely gone after a close,
that the X is still on screen after scrolling to the bottom, that nothing sits on
top of it, and that choosing a file does not close the panel.

**The panel's length was the underlying cause and is fixed too.** It rendered
every release note at once and measured 17,000–25,000px. Fixing the header's
position without that would have left it just as unusable to read. Older releases
are folded behind one control; nothing is removed.

### B-09 · Language
COGA-informed: plain words, one idea per line, no idioms, no shame. Error and
empty states say what happened and what to do. Nothing is phrased as a rebuke.

### B-10 · The brand colours — the first colour decision this app has made
Everything above states *channels*. These are the first actual values, and they
are recorded here rather than in a stylesheet because B-08's rule is that a new
foreground/background pair joins the gate **in the same commit that introduces
it**. `tools/brand.mjs` is that gate for these.

- **`--field`**
  - Value: `#F4F1E9`
  - What it is: warm paper — the field the mark sits on
- **`--wall`**
  - Value: `#33425F`
  - What it is: the sheltering form — a wall, not a marker
- **`--light`**
  - Value: `#F5C978`
  - What it is: the lit opening. The **only** warm note in the identity
- **`--type-strong`**
  - Value: `#F7F4EE`
  - What it is: the wordmark
- **`--type`**
  - Value: `#E9EDF4`
  - What it is: secondary type on dark

**Measured, not eyeballed** — every pair the mark actually renders:

- **wall / field**
  - Ratio: **8.92:1**
  - Needs: 3:1
  - Why that threshold: WCAG 1.4.11, non-text graphical object
- **light / wall**
  - Ratio: **6.48:1**
  - Needs: 3:1
  - Why that threshold: same
- **wordmark / plate**
  - Ratio: **8.50:1** worst
  - Needs: 4.5:1
  - Why that threshold: measured against the actual social-preview pixels behind it, at the worst sample
- **tagline / plate**
  - Ratio: **8.45:1** worst
  - Needs: 4.5:1
  - Why that threshold: same
- **rule / plate**
  - Ratio: **7.34:1** worst
  - Needs: 3:1
  - Why that threshold: same

### Why the field is light, and why that was not just a taste call

The first palette was near-black (`#131B2E` field, `#5C6E8F` wall) and A requirement:
something less dark. **Simply paling everything is impossible here, and the arithmetic says
why.** The mark is a three-step ladder — wall must clear 3:1 above the field, and the light
must clear 3:1 above the wall — so it needs roughly a **9:1 span** end to end. A light field
leaves no room upward; every "lift the whole thing" variant failed the second step at
2.0–2.4:1.

**So the wall inverted instead.** Light paper, dark wall, warm opening. The opening still
reads as *lit* because what surrounds it is dark — that is the one property the whole idea
depends on, and paling the wall would have destroyed it.

The lighter palette is also **measurably more legible**, which is the part worth keeping:
the ladder went from 3.34:1 / 3.45:1 to **8.92:1 / 6.48:1**, and in grayscale the old wall
nearly merged with its field at 32–48px where the new one stays crisp. The taste call and
the measurement agreed.

The social preview's source image is dusk-dark and is lifted `brightness(1.35)
saturate(1.05)` in the composite. Heavier lifts were rendered and rejected: at 1.8 and 2.4
the scene flattens and the single small lamp stops reading as a light, which is the whole
subject.

**The warm note is never an alarm.** `--light` is the app's one warm colour and it
means *lit*, *held*, *here* — never *late* and never *wrong*. B-01's no-red-walls
rule is a palette rule as well as a pressure-surface rule: **no red or amber
enters this identity**, because a colour that means "attention" in the brand will
eventually mean "you failed" in the UI.

**Grayscale survival is checked, not assumed.** The gate asserts the shelter and
the field stay separated with hue removed — the same pass condition B-01 sets for
every pressure surface, applied to the identity so the two cannot drift apart.

**Proven in CI, not just locally.** Spine **run 9** (`4f03e9a`) — the palette above —
watched green, with every ratio identical to the local run: `8.92:1`, `6.48:1`,
`8.50:1`, `8.45:1`, `7.34:1`. Run 7 was watched the same way on the superseded
palette. Per [V-10](docs/verifications.md), a gate nobody has watched pass is a
file. CI installs **chromium build v1194**, the revision `playwright-core` 1.56.0
pins to — the matched pair holds on a machine that is not this sandbox.

### B-11 · The app's own colours, both themes
B-10 is the identity. These are the **interface** tokens in `public/app.css`,
which is a separate question — an icon is seen once, a surface is lived in.

- **`--bg`**
  - Light: `#F4F1E9`
  - Dark: `#141A26`
- **`--surface`**
  - Light: `#FFFFFF`
  - Dark: `#1E2637`
- **`--ink`**
  - Light: `#1B2333`
  - Dark: `#F2F0EA`
- **`--ink-soft`**
  - Light: `#4C5670`
  - Dark: `#B3BCCE`
- **`--line`**
  - Light: `#CFCABD`
  - Dark: `#3A4560`
- **`--accent`**
  - Light: `#33425F`
  - Dark: `#AFC0DC`
- **`--warm`**
  - Light: `#7A4E00`
  - Dark: `#F5C978`

**Measured in both themes**, worst case of the two:

- **ink / bg**
  - Light: 13.94:1
  - Dark: 15.29:1
  - Needs: 4.5:1
- **ink / surface**
  - Light: 15.73:1
  - Dark: 13.28:1
  - Needs: 4.5:1
- **ink-soft / bg**
  - Light: 6.48:1
  - Dark: 9.13:1
  - Needs: 4.5:1
- **ink-soft / surface**
  - Light: 7.31:1
  - Dark: 7.93:1
  - Needs: 4.5:1
- **accent / bg**
  - Light: 8.92:1
  - Dark: 9.45:1
  - Needs: 3:1
- **accent / surface**
  - Light: 10.07:1
  - Dark: 8.21:1
  - Needs: 3:1
- **warm / surface**
  - Light: 7.20:1
  - Dark: 9.73:1
  - Needs: 4.5:1
- **warm / bg**
  - Light: 6.38:1
  - Dark: 11.21:1
  - Needs: 4.5:1
- **line / surface**
  - Light: 3.45:1
  - Dark: 3.42:1
  - Needs: 3:1 (WCAG 1.4.11 — it is a control boundary)

**`--warm` is not the brand warm, and that is the point.** `#F5C978` is a
*light* — beautiful as a lit opening, unreadable as text on paper. In the light
theme the interface uses a deep amber at 7.20:1 instead. **The same meaning has to
survive a different job, and the way it survives is by changing value, not by
being used at the wrong contrast.**

**A card does not rely on its fill.** `--surface` against `--bg` is only ~1.14:1
in both themes, so cards carry a border. One channel is never enough — the same
rule as B-01, applied to layout instead of pressure.

**`--line` is a graphical object, not decoration.** It draws the boundary of the
text input and every ghost button, so it is held to WCAG 1.4.11's 3:1 and joins
the gate (`brand.mjs` UI_PAIRS) — the audit found it carved out with no floor at
1.45:1, invisible to both gates.

**The triage surface (Phase 2) adds no new tokens, only one new pair.** The heat
and clarify cards live on `--surface`; the route buttons and the do-now timer sit
on `--bg`. Every pairing was already covered except the timer label, `--warm` on
`--bg` — added above and to the `brand.mjs` gate in the commit that introduced the
timer. The rendered surface is also audited directly: `tools/a11y.mjs` renders
both the heat and clarify passes in both themes, measures the route buttons' focus
rings, and judges the lowest-contrast text on the surface — the route hint
(`--ink-soft` on `--bg`, 6.48:1 light).

**The gate covers these.** `tools/brand.mjs` reads the tokens out of
`public/app.css` for both themes and fails on any pair below its floor, so B-08's
same-commit rule is enforced rather than promised.

### B-22 · The note, the log viewer, and per-node history (1.4.0)

**No new tokens, no new pairs — three new surfaces on the existing bindings,
each added to the rendered gate in this same commit.**

- **The note textarea** (`#detail-note`): `--ink` on `--bg` with a `--line`
  border, the same skin as every input on the sheet, sized to B-04 and resizable
  vertically only — a horizontal drag could push the sheet past the 320px
  overflow gate. **No placeholder, by design**: the hint paragraph carries the
  guidance, so there is no low-contrast ghost text to measure or to mistake for
  content. Registry: the `detail sheet` state gains `#detail-note`,
  `#detail-note-set`, and `#detail-history summary`.
- **The record itself** (`log view` state): day headings and lines in `--ink`,
  the stated total in the storage-note style. Lines wrap
  (`overflow-wrap: anywhere`) — the (i) dialog's 320px scrollWidth check holds
  for this list, and the driver collapses the view again afterwards so the
  return-visit overflow measurement stays honest.
- **The cure lines** (`.log-cure`, in `log view` and
  `detail sheet, history open`): `--ink-soft`, indented — the quietest text in
  the app's story and exactly the lines that explain the app's own writes, so
  they are registered and measured rather than waved through as secondary. The
  driver stages the history on a captured-then-routed item, whose gate cure
  guarantees the selector something real to match (a selector matching nothing
  visible FAILS, per the B-08 registry rule).

### B-23 · Wholesale acts and the trash view (1.5.0)

**No new tokens; three new surfaces on the existing bindings, each in the
rendered gate in this same commit.**

- **The wholesale block** (`sort bulk verbs` state): verb buttons reuse the
  route-button skin; the preview sentence is `detail-hint` class but carries
  the act's terms — measured, not waved through. The place filter has a
  placeholder, so it inherits the placeholder rule. A selected verb is marked
  with `aria-pressed` AND a 2px `--ink` outline — never colour alone (B-01).
- **The destructive confirm** (`sort bulk confirm` state): revealed by
  choosing Let-them-go and audited OPEN, per the purge rule — a control that
  only exists after a click is still a control somebody reads. The typed-word
  box is the surface standing between a person and six-hundred decisions.
- **Things you let go** (`trash view` state): rows are real buttons at full
  target size on `--surface` with a `--line` border; the count line rides the
  storage-note style. The driver stages a genuinely trashed item through the
  app's own path (capture → sheet → let go), so the row the gate measures is
  a real one.
- The status line and receipt are `role="status"` live regions; the a11y
  driver's tab-walk covers the new controls within the raised 60-stop budget.

### B-24 · Seeing and choosing (1.6.0)

**No new tokens; five new surfaces on the existing bindings, each in the
rendered gate in this same commit.**

- **The tree** (`tree open` state): rows are full-width buttons on
  `--surface` with `--line` borders; depth is INDENTATION ONLY — structure
  never rides on colour or weight (B-01 applied to hierarchy). The branch
  remainder ("N more under it") is a real dashed-border button in
  `--ink-soft`, measured, not decoration.
- **The doors** (the behind-list and coverage rows became buttons): the
  coverage row keeps its two-span layout inside a bordered button
  (`.coverage-open`, in the `coverage open` state); the behind-list button is
  borderless inside the Next-up card and relies on the global focus ring,
  audited via the `next up` state's ring pass. Both open the sheet on the
  FRESH node.
- **Composed Today** (`composed strip` + `today opt-in` states): the strip's
  rows are doors at full target size; the opt-in Extra follows the comms
  shape and is audited in its RESTING (off) state — the state every user
  actually meets first. The sheet's Today buttons join the detail-sheet
  audit implicitly via the group's standard controls.
- **The session close** (`close strip` state): the words are the whole
  surface — the win line and the gauge line are ordinary `--ink`-class text
  and the gauge is stated in words, never colour (B-02's rule made load-
  bearing). Driven by actually ending a session, then lowered so later
  states see the ordinary page.

### B-25 · Duplicates and the lens (1.7.0)

**No new tokens; two new surface families on the existing bindings, each in
the rendered gate in this same commit.**

- **The fold verb** (`detail sheet, folding` / `folded away` / `survivor`
  states): the filter input's placeholder joins the registered
  `--ink-soft` pair — the UA default measured 4.08:1 light / 3.78:1 dark on
  the sheet and failed the gate, the same finding the 1.3.0 inputs had. The
  SELECT is audited only in the `folding` state, where legal targets exist:
  with nothing else held it renders disabled, and a disabled control is not
  the state a person meets the verb in. The survivor's "Split it back out"
  rows are real ghost buttons at full target size, measured per state.
- **The lens** (`lens row` state, audited ACTIVE): the row's label and the
  law-1 line are `--ink-soft` on `--bg` (6.48:1 light); the select is
  ordinary `--ink`. The line renders only while a lens is chosen, so the
  state stages one, measures, and resets. The select carries
  `aria-describedby="lens-note"` so what the lens is NOT doing is announced
  with it. Finding on first run: a flex item's `min-width: auto` let a long
  container title push the page sideways 257px at 320px/200% (B-04) —
  `min-width: 0` on the select, fixed in the same commit.

### B-26 · The panel folds, and toggles say what they do (1.7.2)

**No new tokens; the group headers became controls on the existing bindings.**

- **The folding groups** (`panel groups` state, ADR-0055): each group header
  is a full-width disclosure button inheriting the header's registered face
  (`--ink-soft` on `--surface`, 6.48:1 light), min-height `--target`, with
  the caret (`::before`, inherits color) carrying open/closed so the NAME
  never changes under a screen-reader user mid-list. Audited in the collapsed
  state a new user actually meets (State 1, via the walkthrough's handoff —
  which unfolds Your data so the storage promise is visible, itself asserted
  in smoke). `aria-expanded`/`aria-controls` on every toggle.
- **Toggle labels state the next press** ("Read the record" ↔ "Close the
  record"; "Things you let go" ↔ "Close the list"): `aria-expanded` alone
  told assistive tech the truth and told a sighted reader nothing — the same
  information now reaches both (WCAG 1.3.1 in spirit; found on device).
- **The thesis page got its styles back**: `why.html`'s inline `<style>` was
  refused by the site's own `style-src 'self'` — the deployed page rendered
  unstyled, unmeasured by every gate because no walk ever navigated there.
  Styles moved to `/why.css` (same tokens), and the smoke walk now visits
  the page.

### B-27 · Asking, and declining (1.8.0)

**No new tokens; three new surfaces on the existing bindings, each in the
rendered gate in this same commit.**

- **The decline group** (`detail sheet` base state gains `#detail-decline`;
  `detail sheet, declined` and `detail sheet, slot offered` are their own
  states — a control that renders only in a state is audited in that state,
  the registry rule). The declined words and the fact line are `.detail-hint`
  class text on the registered pair; the slot-park button NAMES the real
  return day, so what it will do is readable before it is pressed.
- **The Not Now ledger** (`ledger open` state): the trash view's exact
  species — rows are full-target doors; the fact line (`.trash-when`,
  `--ink-soft` on `--surface`) is the quietest text and the row's whole
  content: a name and a date, never a count (law 5 asserted over the
  rendered words in smoke). Toggle labels state the next press.
- **The slot control** (`#slot-day`/`#slot-set`, in `DIALOG_COMMON`): a
  native select and a ghost button on existing tokens; the status note rides
  the registered `--warm` storage-note pair and states the chosen day in
  words, never colour.

### B-28 · Who cares, and what was decided (1.9.0)

**No new tokens; two new sheet groups on the existing bindings, both in the
rendered gate in this same commit.**

- **Who cares how this goes** (`detail sheet, who cares`): a name in ordinary
  `--ink` and one ghost verb per row at full target size, each carrying its
  own `aria-label` ("Take Sam off the list") so a screen-reader user hears
  WHICH person a repeated button is about — the merged-list precedent.
- **What was decided** (`detail sheet, decisions`): the textarea takes the
  note editor's registered rules (prose-shaped, vertical resize only so a
  drag cannot push the sheet past 320px, and **no placeholder** by design).
  The row's day (`.detail-when`, `--ink-soft` on `--surface`) is the quietest
  text on the sheet and it is a DAY — never a count, never a verdict. Rows
  carry no control at all: the log is read-only, asserted structurally in
  smoke rather than by reading copy.
- **Nothing anywhere is keyed to how many** stakeholders or decisions a thing
  has — no colour, no weight, no ordering by volume. That absence is the
  measurement (B-01, law 5). The portfolio's clause names people rather than
  counting them, and its overflow number is a true count of what is not
  shown, in the caps convention's own grammar.

## Part 2 — Findings register

Rows are appended as found.

### F-01 · Storage details invalid as a definition list to assistive tech
Found: 2026-07-28 · `tools/a11y.mjs`, its **first ever run** (axe `definition-list`, serious)
Rule: WCAG 1.3.1 Info and Relationships
Detail: the ⓘ panel appended its storage explanation as a direct child of the
`<dl>` — first as a `<p>`, and axe 4.10.2 rejected the `<div>` retry too. A
screen reader walking the list would meet prose where a term/definition pair
belongs. Moved outside the list as a sibling paragraph; the registry now audits
it at `#storage-note` (7.20:1 light / 9.73:1 dark).
Status: **FIXED in 0.2.2**, same commit that stood the gate up — which is the
point of B-08's same-commit rule.

### F-02 · The a11y gate passed a build with focus rings, placeholder and target sizes broken
Found: 2026-07-28 · adversarial audit of the gate itself
Rule: B-06 (focus rings, ≥44px), B-08 (no exceptions incl. placeholder/disabled)
Detail: a reviewer copied `tools/a11y.mjs` verbatim, deleted `:focus-visible`
outlines, dropped the placeholder to 1.44:1, shrank a link to 20px and made the
input border transparent — the gate printed **66 ok, 0 FAIL**. The values shipped
were fine; nothing measured them. `sampler` never passed a pseudo-element, no
function read `outlineWidth`, `auditTargets` tested height only and in one of
three states, and the everyday (return-visit) dialog was never rendered.
Status: **FIXED in 0.2.3** — the gate now samples `::placeholder`, Tab-navigates
and measures each focus ring's style/width/contrast, checks width and height in
every state, renders the return-visit dialog and the dialog at 320/200, runs axe
at the stressed viewport, and enables reduced-motion. **Re-run against the exact
attack: 23 failures, exit 1.** The gate was made to fail before being re-trusted
(§6), a second time and harder.

### F-03 · The text input and ghost buttons had no 3:1 boundary; `--line` was carved out of the gate
Found: 2026-07-28 · audit
Rule: WCAG 1.4.11 (non-text contrast of UI-component boundaries)
Detail: `--line` drew the border of `#capture` (a form control) and every ghost
button at **1.45–1.83:1**, and B-11 listed the pair with "Needs: —" so no gate
watched it. A control's visible boundary needs 3:1.
Status: **FIXED in 0.2.3** — `--line` retuned to `#8E8A7F` (3.45:1 on surface,
3.05:1 on bg) / `#6A7896` (3.42 / 3.93), and its floor added to `brand.mjs`
`UI_PAIRS` and to B-11, so the carve-out is closed.

### F-04 · A long error message overflowed the page sideways at 320px/200%
Found: 2026-07-28 · audit
Rule: WCAG 1.4.10 Reflow
Detail: `#status` used `overflow-wrap: normal`, so an error containing one
unbroken token (a quoted id, a URL) produced 449px of horizontal page scroll at
the reference stress viewport.
Status: **FIXED in 0.2.3** — `#status` and every dialog descendant wrap with
`overflow-wrap: anywhere`; the gate now asserts page AND dialog overflow ≤1px.

### F-05 · Focus fell to `<body>` after every triage tap
Found: 2026-07-29 · Phase 2 adversarial audit
Rule: WCAG 2.4.3 Focus Order
Detail: the clarify surface rebuilds its buttons with `replaceChildren` on every
heat/route tap, removing the control the user just activated; nothing moved focus,
so a keyboard or screen-reader user was dumped to `<body>` and had to Tab back down
after each of up to twelve taps — in a flow whose whole point is "keyboard-first,
one card at a time". `auditFocusRings` could not see it: it blurs and Tabs from
scratch and never activates a control to see where focus lands.
Status: **FIXED (0.4.0, pre-promote)** — focus moves to the prompt heading
(`tabindex=-1`), or to the capture line once the inbox is clear; the prompt, not the
first route, so an accidental double-activation cannot fire Trash. `a11y.mjs` now
activates a route and asserts focus is not `<body>`, made to fail first.

### F-06 · A dated card status overflowed the card at 320px/200%
Found: 2026-07-29 · Phase 2 a11y gate (downstream of [V-13](docs/verifications.md))
Rule: WCAG 1.4.10 Reflow
Detail: `.card-when` was `flex: 0 0 auto` — fixed to its content width, never
wrapping. When the same-day clock reads a dated "returns \<day\>" rather than the
short "returns today" (the end-of-UTC-day issue, V-13), the label was wide enough to
push the page ~6px sideways at the reference stress viewport.
Status: **FIXED (0.4.0, pre-promote)** — `.card-when` is `flex: 0 1 auto; min-width:0`
so it shrinks and wraps within the card on its own line; the gate asserts page
overflow ≤1px in this state.

### F-07 · A `display` rule silently defeated the `hidden` attribute
Found: 2026-07-29 · Phase 3 smoke walk
Rule: WCAG 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (state must match what is rendered)
Detail: `.coverage { display: flex }` overrides the user-agent's
`[hidden] { display: none }`, so the coverage list rendered **fully expanded**
while its `hidden` attribute was set and its toggle button reported
`aria-expanded="false"`. Assistive tech and sighted users were told two different
things, and every gate that asked "is it hidden?" by attribute was satisfied. Any
element given a `display` value is exposed to this; it is a property of the
cascade, not a one-off mistake.
Status: **FIXED (0.5.0)** — a global `[hidden] { display: none !important }` now
leads `app.css`, so no future `display` rule can reintroduce it, and the smoke
walk asserts the list starts closed and that `aria-expanded` tracks it.

### F-08 · Finishing the last item stranded focus on `<body>`; failures were announced but invisible
Found: 2026-07-29 · Phase 3 adversarial audit
Rule: WCAG 2.4.3 Focus Order; Doctrine §5 (honesty) for the second half
Detail: two defects in the same surface. (1) `work.ts` moved focus only
`if (!REGION.hidden)` — but the region hides *precisely because* the last item was
completed, so finishing the final thing left focus on `<body>`. `clarify.ts`
already handled the identical case with a fallback to the capture line; work mode
did not copy it across, and neither did the a11y gate, so the one check that would
have caught it was the one not written. (2) A failed write was reported only into
`#nextup-live`, which is `visually-hidden` (measured 0×0) — a sighted user tapped
Done, saw nothing change, and had no way to learn the write had failed, while
capture puts the identical failure in the visible `#status`.
Status: **FIXED (0.5.1)** — `restoreFocus()` falls back to `#capture` when the
region hides, and failures are written to both the live region and the visible
status line. An in-flight guard also stops a double-tap recording the same action
twice.

Format:

```
### F-01 · <one-line symptom>
Found: <date> · <how — audit, device, report>
Rule: WCAG <SC> / Doctrine §4 <clause>
Detail: <what was measured, with the number>
Status: OPEN | FIXED in <version.capability.iteration>
```

A row's `Detail` must carry the **measurement**, not an impression — "popup
buttons measured 1.26:1", not "contrast looked low".

### B-29 · A timer that shows presence, not progress (1.10.0)

**No new colour tokens.** The presence mark uses `--warm`, already bound and
already measured; the timer's words sit in `.donow-label` on the same binding
they have always used, so the rendered gate covers both without a new pair.

- **The presence mark** (`.donow-running`): a 0.6rem dot that pulses between
  full and 0.35 opacity. It is `aria-hidden`, deliberately — it carries no
  information a screen-reader user needs, because everything it signifies is
  already in the label's own words ("Five minutes, running."). A decorative
  mark that announces itself is noise.
- **`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` turns the pulse off and leaves the mark at
  full opacity.** Not `display: none`: the reduced-motion user still gets the
  same signal, held still. A still frame of something meant to move would be
  ambiguous; a steady mark is not.
- **Nothing here encodes an amount, and that is an accessibility property as
  well as a product one.** A pulsing dot has no state a low-vision user has to
  judge by size or by arc length, and no colour that has to be read as a
  quantity. Pressure and decay never ride on hue (B-02); this now holds for
  elapsed time too, because there is no quantity rendered at all.
- **The end of a timer is announced, never silent.** The bar removes itself and
  one line goes to `#triage-live` (`role="status"`, `aria-live="polite"`). A
  control that vanishes with no announcement is a control that disappeared for
  a screen-reader user with no way to know it had — which is why "it just goes
  away" is implemented as *goes away and says so once*, not as silence.
- **The length control** (`#timer-length`, `#timer-length-set`,
  `#timer-length-note`) is the request-slot pattern exactly: a labelled
  `<select>`, a ghost button at full target size, and a `role="status"` note
  that states what is now set. Measured in the `dialog` states of the rendered
  gate alongside `#slot-day`, which shares its bindings.

### B-30 · The offer, and the wish inside it (1.11.0)

**No new colour tokens.** The offer reuses `.behind-item` / `.behind-title` /
`.behind-why`, already bound and already in the rendered gate; the wish adds a
`--line` rule and an italic on top of those bindings, both of which the existing
pairs already cover.

- **The wish is never distinguished by hue** (B-02, and law 6 besides). It says
  *"something you wanted"* in words — that is the message. The left rule and the
  italic are redundant signals layered on the words, not carriers of meaning, so
  nothing is lost to a reader who cannot see either.
- **The wish row carries no `Done`.** That is a product ruling (acting on a Menu
  item is a deliberate promotion) with an accessibility consequence worth
  stating: the row has exactly one control and one purpose, so its accessible
  name is the whole of what it does.
- **The offer's line no longer states a number.** Screen-reader users heard
  "8 things are asking" on every render of the main surface; the honest total is
  now announced once, by the coverage gauge that exists to carry it, rather than
  twice with the second framed as demand.
- **Target sizes are unchanged** — the rows are the same `.behind-open` buttons
  measured since 1.6.0, and the wish adds padding rather than removing any.

### B-31 · A person's own page (1.12.0)

**No new colour tokens.** The group reuses `.detail-label`, `.detail-hint`,
`.detail-feed`, `.detail-when` and the `linklike` button, all already bound and
already measured.

- **Names on an item became buttons.** They were `<span>`s, which means a
  keyboard or screen-reader user had no way to reach a person at all — not a
  contrast problem but a reachability one, and the more serious of the two. The
  a11y gate now Tabs to a row in the person group and measures its focus ring.
- **The registry entry is scoped to the group, not to one of its two lists.**
  What someone owes you and where else they come up render through identical
  bindings, and which list is populated depends on the kind of thing they are
  linked to. An entry naming one list would pass or fail on fixture shape rather
  than on contrast — which is exactly how the first version of this driver
  failed, correctly, when it linked a person to a project and then looked for an
  owed row.
- **The group is shown even when nothing is with them.** "Nothing is with them
  just now" is an answer; a group that disappears leaves the question looking
  unanswerable, which is the empty-state rule this register already records.
- **Nothing on the page is a grade.** Durations and relationships only — law 7,
  and it is an accessibility property too: there is no colour, position or
  emphasis carrying a judgement that a reader has to decode.

### B-32 · The journal, in its three states (1.13.0)

**No new colour tokens.** The journal reuses `.storage-note`, `.detail-label`,
`.detail-hint`, `.about-caveat` and `.trash-list`, all already bound and
measured; all three states are in the rendered gate in this same commit.

- **Three states, all audited, because a person meets all three**: no passphrase
  yet, closed, and open. Each is driven in the order it is actually encountered
  rather than staged directly, so the gate measures what a reader sees.
- **The forgotten-passphrase text is the longest quiet passage on the surface**,
  and it is the one sentence ADR-0005 requires to be readable rather than buried.
  It sits on `.about-caveat`, measured at 320px and 200% like everything else —
  a warning nobody can read is not a warning.
- **Closed is announced as a state, not an error.** `#journal-state` is
  `role="status"` with `aria-live="polite"`, and it says "The journal is closed."
  A screen-reader user is told what is true, in the same words a sighted one
  gets; nothing here is styled as a failure, because none of it is one.
- **A wrong passphrase is announced through the same live region**, in one
  sentence carrying no number and no fragment of the entry. Silence here would
  be worse than a rebuke: a wrong passphrase that appeared to succeed would show
  an empty journal, which reads as *your entries are gone*.
- **The passphrase boxes are real `type="password"` inputs** with the right
  `autocomplete` values — `new-password` when setting, `current-password` when
  opening — so a password manager can fill them and nobody is forced to type a
  long passphrase by hand on a touch keyboard.

### B-33 · The copy, and the way back (1.14.0)

**One new class, no new colour pair.** `.restore-note` carries `--ink-soft` on
the page background — the pair `.empty` already uses and the gate already
measures — and it is registered as its own selector all the same, because a pair
that is measured through one selector is not measured for another. `#copy-note`
reuses `.storage-note`. Both are in the rendered gate in this commit.

- **The way back is audited on the only screen it appears on.** `#restore` shows
  when the store is empty and nowhere else, so it joins the `empty store` state —
  which is exactly the screen somebody reaches after clearing their browser.
  Its focus ring is measured there too: this is a control people meet on their
  worst day with the app, and a control you cannot see yourself land on is one
  more thing going wrong.
- **The copy note is registered where it renders, not where it is declared.**
  It is hidden when there is nothing to say, which on a brand-new store is the
  truth — so registering it in `DIALOG_COMMON` would have named a selector that
  matches nothing visible, and this gate fails on that by design. It is bound to
  `dialog, return visit`, where the walk has a real history and no export.
- **`.restore-note` is deliberately not a second dashed box.** Two `.empty`
  boxes stacked read as two problems. The offer sits quietly under the calm
  sentence rather than competing with it.
- **Silence is a state, and it is the covered one.** Nothing renders when the
  copy is current — no "you are up to date" line, and so nothing for a screen
  reader to announce either. What is announced is only ever a fact somebody can
  act on.

### B-34 · Load, not work (1.15.0)

**No new colour tokens.** The load entry reuses `.bother-entry`,
`.detail-label`, `.detail-hint`, `.detail-row`, `.trash-list` and
`.nextup-count` — every one already bound and measured. Two new states are in
the rendered gate in this same commit.

- **A collapsed control is still a control.** The entry is a `<details>` closed
  by default, so the driver opens it and audits what is inside, the way it has
  audited the bother entry since 0.17.0.
- **The placeholder needed its own rule**, and the gate caught it: the UA
  default grey measured 4.08:1 against a 4.5:1 requirement. `#pebble-text`
  joins `#bother-text` on the explicit `--ink` rule. A placeholder is text
  somebody has to read to know what the box wants.
- **`#nextup-load` is registered in its own state, not with the entry.** It
  renders only while something is on you, and naming it beside the entry would
  have named a selector matching nothing visible — which this gate fails on by
  design. It is also why the audit sits immediately after `next up`: the line
  lives inside the offer, and an offer that is not showing has no line.
- **Nothing about weight rides on colour.** Heavier is a WORD — a pebble, a
  rock, a boulder — and the shorter offer is a shorter list, not a warmer one.
  B-02's rule (the gauge speaks in words, never hue) applies here unchanged.
- **The row carries one verb**, like the trash view. "Settled", not "Done":
  nothing here was work, so nothing here is completed.
- **The list is announced by the surface it changes**, not by a live region of
  its own. Adding a weight repaints Next up, which already carries
  `#nextup-live`; a second announcement for the same act would talk over it.

### B-35 · A whole invented life, as a file (1.16.0)

- **The two sample controls have separate headings**, and that is an
  accessibility decision as much as an editorial one. One adds a little work to
  your store; the other makes a file of several hundred invented things and
  touches nothing. Two buttons under one heading would make a screen-reader
  listener choose between them from their labels alone, with the caveat that
  distinguishes them attached to only one of them.
- **`#big-sample-note` is a `role="status"` live region**, like `#sample-note`
  and the storage note beside them — the same shape for the same job, so a
  reader who has met one has met all three.
- **The button says "Making it…" before the work starts.** Deriving the
  journal's key is PBKDF2 at 600,000 iterations and the set is ~1,570 events
  through the write gate, so there is a real pause on a tablet. A control that
  goes quiet for two seconds reads as a broken one, and this audience is the
  least well served by having to guess whether a tap registered.
- **The button is disabled only while it runs**, and comes back either way —
  including on failure. A control that stays disabled after an error strands
  somebody with no way to retry and no statement of what happened.
- **No new colour pair.** The block reuses `.about-section`, `.about-p`,
  `.about-caveat`, `.ghost` and `.storage-note`, all measured since B-08; the
  two new selectors are added to the contrast registry in this same commit and
  measure 10.07:1 and 7.20:1 in light, 8.21:1 and 9.73:1 in dark.
- **The caveat states the destructive half in the caveat's own place**, not
  inside the button label: bringing the file back in replaces what is on the
  device. The act that replaces is the existing import, which already carries
  its own warning and its own confirm — this text points at it rather than
  duplicating it, so there is one place where that fact is stated authoritatively.

### B-36 · Named periods (1.17.0)

- **The two text boxes carry the 44px floor from `--target`, not from a number**,
  and the gate caught them at **21px** before this shipped — the UA default,
  less than half the floor. Borrowed wholesale from `#purge-word` for the reason
  that control already states: a surface somebody reaches for at a moment they
  are not at their best. The select carries it too.
- **The placeholder colour is set explicitly.** The UA grey is a colour nobody
  chose and it fails the contrast gate; `#pebble-text` and `#capture` already
  carry the same correction, so this is the third instance of one rule rather
  than a new one.
- **The row wraps rather than widening.** `.anchor-list li` is a flex row with
  `flex-wrap`, so at 320px the button drops below the name instead of pushing
  the panel into a horizontal scroll (B-04's hardest viewport).
- **`#anchor-note` is a `role="status"` live region**, like every other note in
  this panel — one shape for one job, so a reader who has met one has met all.
- **The verb is "It came round", not "Done".** Nothing here was work, so nothing
  here is completed: a period ended, which is a different sentence and a
  different mental model. Same reasoning as "Settled" on a weight (B-34).
- **The heading is `.about-sub`, one level below `.about-section`**, because
  anchors sit INSIDE the report section. An anchor answers "since when" for a
  report and has no other job; its own section would announce it to a
  screen-reader listener as a separate area to maintain, which is precisely what
  it is not.
- **The picker keeps its value across a repaint.** The list is rebuilt from the
  log whenever the panel opens or an anchor changes, and a repaint landing
  mid-choice is how a surface throws away an answer somebody was in the middle of
  giving — the detail sheet's no-clobber rule, applied to a select.
- **No new colour pair.** Everything reuses tokens measured since B-08; the six
  new selectors joined the contrast registry in this same commit.

### B-37 · The diagnostic report (1.18.0)

- **The build stamp became a button and did NOT become button-shaped.** It is a
  stamp you can press, not a call to action in the footer: the chrome is
  stripped to an underline, and only the 44px target floor and the padding are
  added. That restraint is load-bearing rather than cosmetic — §7e's rule is
  that the information surface must never cost the app height, and the whole
  reason the footer was safe to use as the door is that it was already there.
- **It still shows the build when nothing else works.** It was a diagnostic
  before it was a control, and the comment beside it has said since 1.7.x that a
  diagnostic which disappears in the state that needs it is the wrong way round.
  Making it a button did not put it inside anything that can fail.
- **The report is a `<pre>` with `tabindex="0"`.** It scrolls inside itself
  (`max-height: 22rem`), and a scrollable region a keyboard cannot reach is
  content a keyboard user cannot read. `user-select: all` so one gesture takes
  the whole report rather than a word of it — the `.key-text` precedent from
  pairing, for the same reason: this is text whose value is being complete.
- **Copy has a stated fallback rather than a silent failure.** When the
  clipboard API refuses — which it does, in more browsers than one would like —
  the note says so and points at the selectable text, because the text is always
  there. A control that fails quietly on the surface people reach for *after
  something has already gone wrong* is the worst place in the app for it.
- **Monospace at 0.8125rem is the smallest type in the app**, so the five new
  selectors joined the contrast registry in this same commit rather than being
  assumed to inherit a measured pair. Measured at 15.73:1 light and 13.28:1
  dark, on `--surface`, which adds no new colour.
- **The focus-ring check itself was found to be order-dependent** while this was
  built, and fixed here: `blur()` does not reset Chromium's sequential-focus
  starting point, so the Tab walk resumed from wherever the previous audit left
  focus and had to wrap the entire surface to reach anything behind it. Four new
  controls pushed two *unrelated* states past the 60-press budget, reporting
  "#journal-write is not keyboard-focusable" about a button that plainly is. The
  walk now focuses the open dialog first, so it is bounded by the surface's own
  size rather than by audit order — and the repair was verified the way the hub's
  own lesson requires: an unreachable control was planted, the gate went red in
  both themes, and only then was the green believed.

### B-38 · An update no longer changes the app underneath a reader (1.18.1)

Doctrine §7h.1 and §4, and it is an accessibility finding rather than only a
release-engineering one — which is why it is recorded here.

- **The failure, in interaction terms.** `public/sw.js` called `skipWaiting()`
  inside `install`, so a new worker took over while the page somebody was reading
  carried on running the previous release's markup and modules. `activate` then
  deleted the old cache, so every later request from that page was served the new
  file. **The app changed under the reader with no announcement, no consent and
  no way back** — the same class as a mode that hands control over silently
  (Doctrine §3), and worse, because there is no indicator to notice.
- **The fix is consent.** The worker waits; a standing line says a newer version
  is ready; nothing moves until the reader presses **Install it now**. Declining
  leaves them on a whole, working build. The line is `role="status"` with
  `aria-live="polite"`, already registered, and it keeps its three plain
  choices — save a copy, install, not now — with the way out wired first.
- **The label now says what the control does (SC 2.5.3).** `Reload now` became
  `Install it now`. It was accurate under the old model, where the update had
  already landed and only a reload remained; under the new one it would have
  described the wrong action. The accessible name is the visible text, as before,
  so the criterion is satisfied by construction rather than by a matching
  `aria-label` — the accident hub LESSONS §29 warns about.
- **No new colour pairs.** The change is behavioural and textual; every selector
  involved was already in the contrast registry, and the gate was re-run in both
  themes with the update strip in its shown state.
- **The reader is never told on a first visit** (§7h.3). The no-controller gate
  moved to the top of `updateIsReady`, above the `waiting` and `installing`
  checks, so somebody thirty seconds into their first-ever load is not informed
  that a new version is ready. It is pinned by a test, and the test was proved by
  planting.
- **Still owed, and stated rather than implied:** the promotion path is asserted
  against the worker's SOURCE and the decision function's logic, not driven
  end-to-end with a real second worker. §7h asks for the real thing, because a
  mocked registration only proves the mock works. Recorded in
  [ADR-0072](docs/adr/0072-an-update-waits-for-the-reader.md).

### B-39 · Saying what is written on a control (SC 2.5.3), and one name per control (1.18.4)

Hub LESSONS §29 has been the rule since 2026-08-03 and was **prose in this
repo**. It is a gate now — `auditNames` in `tools/a11y.mjs`, run on every state
in both themes — and it found five live defects on its first execution, one of
them in production.

- **The ⓘ button was the §29 case exactly.** `aria-label="About Quietkeep,
  storage, and what's new"` on a button showing the single letter `i`. A
  substring SC 2.5.3 check passes that, because "about" contains an i — for a
  reason with nothing to do with the criterion. Someone driving by voice cannot
  say "i". **The fix is the markup icons already use:** the glyph is
  `aria-hidden`, the name lives in a `.visually-hidden` sentence, and there is
  no visible text for 2.5.3 to be about.
- **"Work on this" answered only to the item's title.** The card button showed
  *Work on this* and announced *"Work on a held thought"* — so saying the words
  on the button matched nothing. The label now LEADS with the visible words and
  keeps the title after a dash, which satisfies 2.5.3 and still disambiguates one
  card from the next (§4). Same shape fixed on *Split it back out* and *Take them
  off*.
- **Both ways out of the ⓘ panel answered to "Close"** — §4's other half. Two
  ways out is required (§4); two ways out with one name is a coin toss by voice.
  Also fixed: three `Set` buttons in the detail sheet, two `Link` buttons, two
  `Done` buttons, and two `Copy it` buttons.

**The duplicate-name half is REPORTED, not gated, and that is deliberate.** Most
collisions it finds are two of the reader's OWN items sharing a title — a card in
a list and the same card in search. The app cannot make a person's titles unique,
and a real store here holds 1,405 actions, so gating it would go red on data
rather than on a defect. **A check that fails on the user's content is not
measuring the app.** It stays visible because the app-authored collisions are
real, and every one of those was fixed on the run that found them.

**Two instrument bugs found while building it, recorded because the check was
wrong before it was right.** A `<select>`'s option list was being read as "the
words on the control", failing every select in the app for text no one sees on
it. And `textContent` concatenates across element boundaries, so a card's title
and status ran together as "a held thoughtnot sorted yet" — which reported a
duplicate under a name no reader would recognise. Both fixed before the gate was
believed (§37: ask whether the pixels are the ones it thinks; §33: a check that
cannot see a thing reports the wrong diagnosis).

### B-40 · The place line says where, in ink already measured (1.20.0)

V2 stage 1. The offer's head card, the rows behind it, and the upkeep chips
gain a lineage line — "in Errands · under Home" — and the filing flow gains a
visible receipt ("Filed under Errands — no return date yet.").

- **No new colour pair ships.** Every new span reuses a text class the
  contrast registry already measures on the same surface (`.nextup-why`,
  `.behind-why`, `.chip-why`); the modifier classes (`.nextup-place`,
  `.behind-place`, `.chip-place`) change layout only. Same ink, same paper,
  one more line — so the registry's existing rows cover it, and the
  same-commit rule (hub LESSONS §28) is satisfied by construction rather than
  by a new registry entry that could drift.
- **The receipt reuses the `.triage-undo-where` bar**, already registered and
  already live-region-paired (`#triage-live`), so screen readers hear the same
  sentence the bar shows.
- **Silence is the accessible default for bareness.** A loose item shows no
  place line at all — `hidden`, not empty text — so a screen reader is not fed
  an empty paragraph, and "in nothing" is never rendered or announced.
- **Voice held by test:** the receipt's no-date branch is pinned to never
  carry "overdue", "late", "still", "haven't", "you should", or "behind" —
  the reproach vocabulary a factual sentence drifts toward one word at a time.

### B-41 · Six destinations, six audited states (1.40.0)

ADR-0083. Help, Settings, Your data, Things you can do and How it works stop
being folding groups inside the ⓘ and become their own screens off More.

**No new tokens and no new colour pair.** Every element came across with its id
and its classes intact, so each is measured against the same foreground /
background binding it was measured against yesterday. What changed is which
surface it is measured ON, and that is the whole finding below.

- **Four screens were being audited as one state, and three of them were not
  being measured at all.** `DIALOG_COMMON` was one list because the panel was one
  dialog. With the groups folded, the walk opened the ⓘ, expanded everything, and
  audited it as a single state — which measured whatever the first group rendered
  and reported the rest as covered. `.about-sub` and `.anchor-label` had been in
  that list for releases while living in what is now Settings; they matched, so
  nothing complained. The registry is split by where each id actually lives now,
  derived from the shipped markup rather than from memory, and the walk drives
  each surface as its own state: *how it works*, *help*, *your data*, *your data,
  return visit*, *things you can do*, *settings*, *clearing out*.
- **A registry entry that matches nothing visible FAILS**, which is what turned
  the split from an assertion into a measurement: nine entries went red the first
  time the walk ran against the new markup, each one naming a control the gate
  had been claiming to check on a screen it was not on.
- **Help's answers are opened before they are audited.** Nine `<details>` closed
  is nine summaries and no answers; auditing it shut would have exempted every
  paragraph a reader actually goes there to read.
- **`#purge-go` is audited in its ENABLED state.** It ships `disabled` until the
  confirmation word is typed, so it is genuinely not focusable and the walk
  reported it unreachable — correct about the DOM and wrong about the app. The
  word is typed, the focus ring on the most consequential button in the product
  is measured, and the field is cleared again. It is never pressed.
- **Every destination carries its own title and its own Close, outside the
  scrolling body** (§4), held by one shared registry list so a sheet that loses
  its way out fails here first.
- **320px at 200% is measured on all six surfaces**, not on the ⓘ alone. The
  sheets carry the code block, the selects and the long words — everything that
  actually overflows — so the old single-surface check could no longer fail for
  the right reason.
- **Every sheet repaints on open.** Half of what these screens show is read from
  the log — the storage rows, the calendar count, the anchor list. Splitting them
  out moved those elements from under the ⓘ's open-time repaint while the panel
  went on calling for them, so a sheet reached straight from More would have shown
  the state the app was in at boot. That is the stale-panel defect this file has
  already recorded twice, and it was introduced and closed inside this release.

**Scroll distance is now budgeted per destination and in total.** The tallest
screen was 3,914px — four phone lengths to reach one switch — and no gate could
see it, because the only height ever measured was the ⓘ's. Every destination is
held to 3,000px and the sum to 10,600px. The sum is stated as a ratchet and not
as an achievement: the split moved 10,425px around and cut nothing.

### B-42 · The link that could not open, and the link that opens the wrong app (1.40.2)

Two findings on the same path — the capture link — reported from an iPad. Neither
is a colour or a name; both are the same class of failure as an unreachable
control, which is why they are recorded here rather than only in the changelog.

- **The entrance could fail outright**, and the browser named it: *"Safari can't
  open the page. The error was: Response served by service worker has
  redirections."* A redirected response is a network error when it answers a
  navigation, and every engine enforces it — Chromium reports the same condition
  as `ERR_FAILED`. The worker's query-strip built a fresh request whose default
  `redirect: "follow"` chased a 3xx the original navigation would have handed
  back untouched. It affected navigations carrying a query and nothing else,
  which is the capture entrance and nothing else.
- **The link may open the wrong app, and say it worked.** V-21, answered on
  device: a Shortcut's *Open URL* opened Safari rather than the installed app.
  The capture succeeded there — *"Held from a link"* — into a separate store the
  installed app never shows. A silent wrong destination is the accessibility
  failure this app can least afford, because the whole promise is that nothing
  is lost. The ⓘ now states what was observed, names what to look at, and
  promises no remedy that has not been seen to work. The caveat rides
  `.about-caveat`, already registered on that surface, so it is measured by the
  same commit that introduces it.

**Why eleven green gates missed a breakage every engine agrees on**, recorded
because the answer is not the flattering one: the local server answered every
path 200 or 404. It could not redirect, so the one edge behaviour that triggers
this was the one behaviour no walk ever had. Not an engine difference — a hole in
the rig. `serve.mjs` can now redirect, and the §7h walk drives one.

**Two false trails on the way, both of which looked exactly like "the fix does
not work":** redirecting to `/index.html` proved nothing, because the browser's
own HTTP cache answered without a request; and `upgrade-insecure-requests` in the
shipped CSP rewrote the redirect to `https://127.0.0.1:<port>` and killed it with
an SSL error. The walk now redirects to a path nothing has ever fetched, and the
server drops that one directive over http — inert in production, destructive
locally.
