  // the bar scrolled away with the content and both ways out ended up at the
  // extremes of a panel thousands of pixels tall.

  // The dependency is gone rather than debugged — the dialog is a flex column
  // that does not scroll and the body is the only thing that moves. These checks
  // are about the PROPERTY, not the mechanism, so they hold whatever CSS is used
  // to achieve it.

  // Two fresh items, so neither half can pass by accident on something the walk
  // did earlier.
  // Routed with an IN-PAGE polling click rather than `routeOne`. By this point
  // the inbox holds whatever earlier blocks left in it, so the card in front of
  // the walk is not necessarily the one just captured, and each queued commit
  // repaints the action row underneath a locator click. This drains until the
  // named item is out of triage, which is the condition that actually matters,
  // and says what it was looking at if it cannot get there.
  //
