// The two-build gate (ADR-0036).
//
// Quietkeep ships as two editions from one branch. The default cannot sync, and
// that claim rests on two independent guarantees, BOTH of which are the kind of
// thing that erodes silently:
//
//   1. the sync module is absent from the default bundle — a build-time
//      exclusion, "verifiable by reading the built artefact", which is what this
//      file actually does rather than trusting the entry point looks right;
//   2. the default origin cannot reach any other host — `tools/headers.mjs`.
//
// It also BUILDS the sync edition, because the alternative is a second `_headers`
// file maintained by hand next to a constant in TypeScript, and the day those
// two disagree is the day the app dials a host the browser blocks (silent, looks
// like "sync is broken") or the CSP allows a host nothing dials (a widened
// posture nobody is using). Generating one from the other makes that
// disagreement unrepresentable.
//
//   node tools/editions.mjs           build both editions and check them
//   node tools/editions.mjs --check   check only; do not write the sync build
//
// Exits non-zero on any failure.
