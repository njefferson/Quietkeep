// That guarantee is one line in `public/_headers`, which makes it exactly the
// kind of thing that erodes quietly: a future session adds a font host, a
// analytics snippet, a "just for debugging" endpoint, and nobody notices that
// the default build is no longer incapable of exfiltration — only unwilling.
//
// So it is gated. This asserts the default build can reach nothing but itself,
// and it is written to fail loudly on the day someone widens it, whether or not
// they meant to.
