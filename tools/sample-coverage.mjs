// The set covers the app (1.16.0, ADR-0067).
//
// ## The defect this exists to prevent
//
// `src/sample.ts` was written at 0.22.0 and was right. Sixteen releases later it
// contained **8 of the 70 event kinds the app emits** and 8 of its 14 node
// kinds, and nothing had ever said so. Every surface built after it — merges,
// dependencies, decisions, the ledger, the trash, Composed Today, focus, weight
// — had never once been seen with data in it. That is not a fixture going
// slightly stale; it is the app's own demonstration quietly ceasing to
// demonstrate the app, in a repo whose whole discipline is that claims get
// checked.
//
// It is the same shape as `emitters.mjs` (a noun nothing writes) and
// `MERGE_DISPOSITION` (a field nobody ruled on): something grows, a list beside
// it does not, and no instrument reports it because nothing is technically
// broken.
//
// ## What it checks
//
// It GENERATES the set and runs it through the real `admit`, then asks what
// kinds actually came out. Not a grep over the source — a grep would pass on a
// kind mentioned in a comment or built in a branch that never runs, and the
// whole point is what the set really contains.
//
// Both directions, like `emitters.mjs`:
//  - every emitted event kind is in the set, or exempted here with a reason;
//  - every node kind is in the folded state, or exempted here with a reason;
//  - **and an exemption for a kind the set now produces is itself a failure**,
//    or the reasons rot into the next quiet lie.
//
// ## Why exemptions exist at all
//
// A reasoned "no" is a fine answer and forcing the sentence IS the gate. What is
// not available is silence.
