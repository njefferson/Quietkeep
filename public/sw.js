// the open page — the page keeps running the PREVIOUS release's HTML and
// modules, while activate below deletes the old cache, so every request that
// page makes afterwards is served the NEW file. Old markup, new modules, no
// reload, and nothing said to anybody. That IS the half-updated shell, and
// skipWaiting is what creates it rather than what avoids it.

// they choose to move. An old app that works is a smaller problem than a mixed
