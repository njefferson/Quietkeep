// Pairing by file, and what it refuses.
//
// Pairing is the one place in this app where somebody handles a SECRET. The key
// in that little JSON file is the whole planner: anyone who opens it can read
// everything either device holds. So the tests here are mostly about refusal —
// what happens when the file is wrong, edited, truncated, or from a version this
// build has never heard of.
//
// The rule underneath all of them: **a pairing that half-worked must be
// impossible.** Every failure mode below leaves the device exactly as it was,
// because the alternative is somebody believing they are paired while nothing
// ever moves — and silence is what this feature's failures look like.
