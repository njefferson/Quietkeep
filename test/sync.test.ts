// than it had, never less.**
//
// Two tests carry the weight. One kills the wire between persisting arrivals and
// recording them, and asserts the events are still there. The other holds the
// line that an unopenable chunk is never marked as taken in — because a chunk
// from a newer version is a device that is ahead, not garbage, and discarding it
// would be permanent.
