// Two devices, one relay, and a thought that crosses between them.
//
// **This is the test that says "sync works".** Everything else in the sync suite
// checks one layer against a fake of the next; this one wires the REAL pieces
// together and asks the only question that matters — capture something on one
// device, and does it come back on the other?
//
// What is real here: two `openSession`s over separate stores, the real gate on
// every keystroke, the real `seal`, the real `exchangeOnce`, the real
// `httpWire`, and the real relay `handle()` — routing, status codes, JSON
// bodies and all. The only thing standing in for hardware is the socket: `fetch`
// is replaced by a function that hands the `Request` straight to `handle()`. The
// relay's own storage is an in-memory `Store`, which is the same interface the
// Cloudflare KV adapter implements.
//
// So a bug anywhere in that chain fails this test, which is the point. It was
// written after two defects — one in event identity, one in the ingestion model
// — got past 567 passing tests, because every one of those tests checked a layer
// against a fake, and neither defect lived inside a layer. They lived in what the
// layers assumed about each other.
