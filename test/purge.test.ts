// Clearing things out (a roadmap requirement).
//
// Three tests carry the weight, and all three are about the guard rather than the
// act:
//
// **`clear` cannot lose history.** It is an append of trash events, so the log
// after it still contains everything, and an export taken afterwards is complete.
// If that ever stops being true, the two modes have collapsed into one and the
// reversible one has quietly become the destructive one.
//
// **The two confirmation words cannot substitute for each other.** With one shared
// word, satisfying the guard for the reversible mode and then switching would
// carry the authorisation across to the irreversible one — somebody loses their
// history to a control they had already passed for something else.
//
// **The count is the real count.** It is the most persuasive thing on the screen at
// that moment, and a confirmation that rounds or estimates has told you nothing.
