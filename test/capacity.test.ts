// Capacity changes WHICH things are offered, never HOW MANY.
//
// The rule is one line and the argument behind it is not. Narrowing the offer on
// a low day is a PACING mechanism: correct for post-exertional conditions, and
// iatrogenic for depression, where behavioural activation says offer anyway. The
// same declaration, two correct and opposite responses — the sharpest of the
// conflicts in the synthesis, and the one that looked like it needed a standing
// preference to resolve.
//
// Changing WHICH dissolves it instead. The same number of offers arrive and the
// lighter ones are chosen: nothing is withdrawn, so activation is served;
// nothing demanding is put in front of you, so pacing is served. No preference
// has to be asked for, which is the better outcome on its own terms.
