// Deferred out of Phase 3 with the reason written down at the time — "needs
// focus ramps, which are Phase 4". This is the thing that reason was waiting
// for, and the tests are about the two properties that make it worth having
// rather than being one more thing that interrupts you:
//
//   it appears ONLY on the way out of a session, and declining costs nothing.
