// file. They prove the arithmetic and the structure from first principles. They
// CANNOT prove a scanner reads the result — the data/EC split comes from the
// specification's tables and a wrong entry produces a well-formed-looking matrix that
// every scanner rejects, with the round trip below passing because it would be wrong
// the same way in both directions. That is V-17, and one photograph settles it.
//
// So the load-bearing tests here are the ones that do NOT depend on my reader:
// the Reed-Solomon syndromes, which are checkable from the definition of the code,
// and the geometry, which is counted rather than looked up.
