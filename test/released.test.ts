// Putting a thing down — the exit that is neither done nor deleted.
//
// The verb exists because law 1's guarantee has a cost: nothing goes quiet, so
// everything you hold comes back for ever until you finish it or bin it. For
// work that mattered and no longer does, both are wrong — Done is a lie in an
// append-only log, and Let it go reads as destroying something you cared about.
// So people carry it, and the reset they actually reach for is deleting the app.
//
// Most of what is pinned here is what it must NOT become: no collection, no
// count, no reason, and a way back that costs nothing.
