// What "held" means (1.15.1, ADR-0066).
//
// The gauge says "N held". The list under it itemises that claim. The todo list
// is what you actually work from. Between 1.13.0 and 1.15.1 those were THREE
// different sets, because the exclusions were hand-written inside `heldGroups`
// and the gauge did not have them — so a journal entry, which has no title by
// design, was itemized in the coverage list as "(untitled) — held".
//
// These tests pin the equality, and they pin the thing that must NOT follow
// from it: `silent` still runs over every node, because a proof that skips a
// kind proves nothing.
