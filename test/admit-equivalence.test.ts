// The reworked admit, held to the old one — event-for-event.
//
// The rework (1.3.0) replaced per-event whole-batch refolds with one running
// accumulator and a dirty-set silent check. Its correctness claim is exactly
// this: for ANY batch against ANY prior state, it returns what the old control
// flow returned — the same events, in the same order, cures included — or
// rejects where the old one rejected, for the same reason. The old flow lives
// verbatim in test/admit-reference.ts as the oracle.
//
// The generator is SEEDED (a plain LCG), so a failure prints its seed and
// replays exactly. No Math.random: a property test that cannot be replayed is
// a rumor, not a counterexample.

 * the merge chain before it ever looks at clocks, so those cures cured nothing
 * (it then re-emitted one per subsequent silent-risk event, forever). The
 * rework skips them and lets the shared whole-batch belt own the case. So the
 * oracle's output is compared AFTER dropping exactly those cures: a `~cure~`
 * event whose target was merged at the moment of emission. Everything else is
 * required to match event-for-event.
