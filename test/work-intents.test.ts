// A smaller bite (1.24.0).
//
// docs/nd-collisions.md entry 1 — task initiation cost. The design rests
// entirely on one property of the write gate, so that property is what these
// tests are about: a node parented to something under a clock is not silent
// (clause (d)), so the bite needs no clock of its own and never becomes a date
// nobody chose.
//
// Everything below goes through `admit`, not `fold`. The whole question is what
// the GATE does with these events; folding them directly would assert the
// author's intention rather than the boundary's behaviour.
