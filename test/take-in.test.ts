// Taking in another device's shard — the road sync and the import button share.
//
// This file exists because the sync driver first did it the OTHER way, re-running
// the gate over everything that arrived. That read as the careful choice and it
// was wrong. The point of these tests is that the reasons are now executable
// rather than remembered: each one first asserts that re-admitting really does
// break, in the specific way claimed, and only then that `takeInEvents` does not.
//
// The first draft of this file got the reasons WRONG — it claimed the gate
// refuses a `node.created` naming an absent parent, and it does not; it cures it.
// Every failure asserted below was checked against the gate before it was
// written down, which is the only reason to trust the argument they support.
