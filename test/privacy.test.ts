// Nothing personal about the owner ever lands in this repo. FAIL state.
//
// The rule, stated by the owner 2026-08-04: nothing personal or embarrassing
// about him is ever recorded in the repo. That is a FAIL state.
//
// The line that decides every case: his design statements are repo material;
// who he is, is not. The product's framing ("a planner for neurodivergent
// users") is public and fine; research about users as a population
// (docs/nd-collisions.md) is fine; a sentence whose predicate is a diagnosis,
// health fact, or identity disclosure and whose subject is the OWNER is not.
// The patterns anchor on exactly that structure — the person, linked by a verb,
// to the term — because the same nouns appear legitimately a hundred times in
// this repo's honest product prose. A rule that lives only in prose loses to
// whoever is in a hurry (hub Doctrine §16.8); this test is the teeth. The hub's
// privacy-check.mjs carries the same patterns for every sibling repo.
//
// The patterns are deliberately NARROW: a false positive teaches sessions to
// route around the gate, and the product's own vocabulary must never trip it.
//
// THIS FILE MAY NOT EXEMPT ITSELF. An earlier version skipped itself whole, on
// the reasoning that a pattern is not a disclosure — true of the patterns and
// false of the prose and fixtures around them, which then went unscanned. Only
// the sentinel region below is skipped, its probes are synthetic rather than
// quoted, and the region itself may carry neither a name nor a date.
