// Membership: which kinds belong where, written down (1.17.2, ADR-0070).
//
// Three of the last four shipped defects were the same defect: a kind on a
// surface it did not belong on. Journal entries itemised in the coverage list
// (1.15.1). Every person ever named sitting in the todo list (1.17.0). The
// detail sheet offering date controls on demand-free kinds that the gate then
// refused (1.17.2 — and the comment beside the code named the rule while the
// code broke it). Each was found by READING, none by a test, because nothing
// asked the question "does this kind belong here?" anywhere.
//
// This file is that question, asked of every list surface at once, over the
// 1.16.0 set-of-everything — the one store that contains every kind. It is the
// `MERGE_DISPOSITION` idiom: one declared table, a written reason per surface,
// and totality both ways. A kind that starts appearing somewhere new fails
// until somebody either allows it with a sentence or excludes it in the code.
//
// TWO-SIDED, deliberately. `actual ⊆ allowed` alone goes green on an empty
// surface (the fixture-not-result lesson, hub LESSONS 7g), so each surface also
// declares `expect`: kinds that MUST be present in the big sample. Between the
// two, the table cannot rot in either direction.
