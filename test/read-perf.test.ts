// The perf gate on the READ path (1.17.1, ADR-0069).
//
// `admit-perf.test.ts` has guarded the write path since 1.3.0. The read path had
// nothing, and the roadmap's own note said why it would stay that way: the
// numbers were EXTRAPOLATED — "~220 ms today, 1.56 s at 10k" — and build-plan
// item 42 defers read-path work to a measurement on the actual device.
//
// 1.16.0 built the instrument. A 566-thing store with every kind in it is a
// fixture you can time, so the number stopped being a guess: **one refresh cost
// ~100 ms, and ~78 of that was resolving the same instants over and over.**
//
// Two gates here, and they fail for different reasons on purpose:
//
//  - **The structural one is deterministic.** It proves the memo exists by
//    identity. A wall-clock test on a shared CI runner is a coin flip at tight
//    bounds and useless at loose ones; this one cannot flake, and it is the check
//    that actually names the mechanism.
//  - **The wall-clock one is loose,** in the same spirit as the admit gate's
//    800 ms bound around a 55 ms operation: it is not there to measure, it is
//    there to catch a return of the shape — which lands multiples over, not
//    fractionally.
