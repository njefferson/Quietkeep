// Named periods — the staff call (1.17.0, ADR-0068).
//
// ADR-0057 deferred anchors with three reasons written down. Two of them are
// what these tests are about, because both were real and both are now answered:
//
//  1. An anchor node was a SILENT node — `anchor` had no exemption and no cure
//     branch, so defining one made the coverage gauge stop reading zero. The
//     gauge is what proves law 1, and a proof that contradicts itself proves
//     nothing.
//  2. `anchor.fired` carried no per-device watermark, so a delta cut on it
//     would be the degraded at-only cut that `reportedBefore` exists to avoid —
//     a shard can deliver work stamped before your last meeting that you had
//     never seen. That was an audit finding on the export path.
