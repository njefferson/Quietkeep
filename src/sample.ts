// A set of sample work, for trying the app out without inventing a life first.
//
// A requirement: a set of test data that can be imported. Two things make it harder
// than it sounds, and both are the reason this is a generator rather than a file:
//
// **It must be relative-dated.** A fixture with `2026-07-30` in it is a fixture
// that is wrong tomorrow and absurd next year — and this app's whole surface is
// temporal, so a stale fixture does not merely look odd, it exercises the wrong
// code paths. Every instant here is computed from the `now` it is handed.
//
// **It must pass the real write boundary.** Sample data that skipped `admit`
// would be sample data that can violate law 1, which would make the app's own
// demonstration a lie about what the app permits. Nothing here is privileged; it
// goes in through the same door as a keystroke.
//
// It deliberately includes the awkward states, not just the tidy ones — something
// whose date has gone by, something waiting on another person, something with no
// clock sitting on the Menu, an unsorted capture or two. A demonstration made
// only of well-behaved rows teaches nothing about the surface that matters.
//
// The content is original. No trigger-list material and nothing that reads as a
// personality: civilian errands and ordinary work, in the app's own voice.
//
// PURE. `now`, the zone and the id/seq stamping are all injected.
