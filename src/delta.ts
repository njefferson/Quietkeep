//
// The arithmetic is the one this whole app is built on: **state = fold(log)**.
// So "what changed since Tuesday" is not a change-log to maintain and keep in
// sync — it is `fold(log up to Tuesday)` compared with `fold(log)`. There is no
// second source of truth to drift, and a delta over an imported history is
// exactly as correct as one over a history this device wrote.
//
// PURE, and it takes both states as arguments.

/**
 * What a report may say changed.
 *
 * `'started'` was declared here, given a heading and a slot in the section
 * order, and emitted by NOTHING — every report carried a section that could
 * not render (found 1.9.0; the OPR defect's exact shape). It is REMOVED
 * rather than implemented, for two reasons that outrank convenience.
 *
 * **It would be a shame ledger.** Started-and-not-finished becomes computable
 * by subtraction across two consecutive reports — in a document you hand to
 * your manager. Nothing else in this app permits that arithmetic, on purpose.
 *
 * **And this app has no in-progress state, deliberately.** Work is held,
 * clocked, or done. Every candidate definition was dishonest or empty: the
 * `start` clock is the DEFER verb (ADR-0045), so reporting it as a start is
 * a lie in the opposite direction; a focus session that opens and closes
 * inside the period is invisible to a two-State diff; and `todayFor` is
 * structurally uncomputable by design (ADR-0051) — reading it in the one
 * artefact that leaves the device would defeat that design.
 *
 * `CHANGE_KINDS` below is exported so a totality test can enumerate them:
 * the durable half of this fix is the invariant that a declared-but-
 * unreachable kind cannot recur.

/**
 * May a kind appear in the report at all?
 *
 * **A TOTAL RECORD, NOT A DENY-LIST, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE FIX.** This was
 * `NOT_REPORTABLE = new Set(['journal','pebble','person','anchor'])`, added by
 * the 1.17.3 seam audit after journal entries were itemised as "New —
 * (untitled)" in the one document built to leave the device. That audit
 * enumerated the four kinds it had just found instead of asking the question
 * over the vocabulary — and its own comment then claimed these were "the same
 * four kinds every work surface excludes", which was false when it was written.
 *
 * `bother` was already in NOT_ACTIONABLE and NO_REPLAN_CARD and was NOT here.
 * So a worry — the flow whose entire pitch is that you may write a private thing
 * down AS a worry rather than as a task — was itemised under "New", by name,
 * verbatim, in the artefact handed to somebody else. Reproduced by running the
 * real intents.
 *
 * A `Record<NodeKind, boolean>` cannot be under-populated: adding a kind to the
 * vocabulary fails to compile until somebody decides, in writing, whether it may
 * leave the device. Same shape as `MERGE_DISPOSITION`, and for the same reason —
 * the safe default is not a default anybody can forget.
 *
 * The reasons, per kind, since a boolean carries none of them:
 *  - `journal` — private by construction and encrypted at rest.
 *  - `pebble` — weight the reader has no business seeing (ADR-0014).
 *  - `person` — a roster change; ADR-0057 ruled rosters out of reports.
 *  - `anchor` — a named period, not news.
 *  - `bother` — a worry, and the thing this record exists for.
 *  - `aspiration` — a want on the Menu. It owes nothing, so it reports nothing.
 *  - `resume-card` — the app's own artifact about where you left off, not work
 *    anybody committed to and not a fact about the portfolio.
