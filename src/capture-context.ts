// When a thing was written down (1.23.0).
//
// `docs/nd-collisions.md` entry 17: working memory holds the context that made
// a captured fragment meaningful, and drops it within hours. The capture
// succeeds; the retrieval cue rots. By the time an item reaches triage, "call
// about the thing" is a stranger's note — so it gets routed blind, or trashed,
// or kept out of a vague guilt that it might have mattered.
//
// Capture itself is right to demand nothing at write time: the moment of
// capture cannot afford a question, and asking one is how a capture box stops
// being used. So the context has to be RECONSTRUCTED rather than requested, and
// the log already holds it — the genesis event's instant is the moment somebody
// wrote this down, and nobody has ever been shown it.
//
// ## What it may not become
//
// It states WHEN. It never states how long ago, in any form: "3 weeks old" and
// "you wrote this in June" are the same fact wearing an accusation, and this
// line appears on the surface where somebody is already working through a
// backlog they feel behind on. No elapsed count, no age, no "still". Law 5, and
// entry 15 — a machine's neutral reminder is read with the same raw nerve, so
// the fix is to give it nothing to read.
//
// A time of DAY rides along where it is close enough to be a real cue —
// "Tuesday evening" is a memory somebody can stand in; "Tuesday, 19:42" is a
// timestamp, and precision here reads as surveillance rather than help.
//
// PURE. `zone` is an argument.
