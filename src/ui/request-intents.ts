// flow's third branch both come through `declinePair` below, so the ledger has
// exactly one write shape. The batch carries its OWN park — each branch
// terminates on its own (the bother-intents rule); the gate's cure for a bare
// `request.declined` stays as backstop for an import or an older shard, never
// as the path the app itself takes.
//
// These build events; they never touch the store.
