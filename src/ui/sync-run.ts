// Running one exchange against a real store and a real relay.
//
// The join between `sync.ts` — which knows the protocol and is tested against
// fakes — and this app's store. It decides only the two things that could not be
// decided anywhere else: where the mark is kept, and how arriving events are
// taken in.
//
// Everything about ORDERING lives in `exchangeOnce`. This file must not reorder
// anything, and it does not.
//
// ## Why arrivals do not go through `commit`
//
// Because `commit` runs the gate, and the gate must not run on another device's
// log. That is argued where it belongs, in `takeInEvents`, and demonstrated in
// `test/take-in.test.ts` — briefly: the events are already-gated history, their
// cures are in the log beside them, and re-admitting duplicates those cures,
// refuses any shard seen twice, and refuses anything whose subject is still in
// the next chunk. This is a shard union (ADR-0035), the same operation the "take
// in what I don't have" button performs, sharing its code.
//
// The one thing that road does not do for itself is live state: the import
// button reloads the page afterwards. Exchange happens on open and cannot, so it
// does TWO things when events land — and it took a device report to learn the
// second was missing. First it calls `session.refresh()`, serialized on the same
// queue as commits, so the in-memory state is once again the fold of the whole
// log. That alone is NOT enough: the state object is correct but every surface is
// still showing what it painted before the exchange, because nothing told it to
// redraw. So it then calls `repaint()` — the app's own "repaint every surface"
// — and only that makes the arrived events appear without a restart. The old
// comment here claimed the refresh was sufficient; it wasn't, and a planner that
// synced onto a phone showed a blank screen until the app was force-quit.
