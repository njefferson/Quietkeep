// The six clarify routes and the heat pass, as event batches.
//
// Each route emits `clarify.routed` PLUS its own terminal event, in one commit,
// so the gate sees the finished intent — the node lands where the route says, not
// wherever the generic cure would put it. A route knows things the generic cure
// cannot: waiting-for is a KIND change, next-action is tomorrow's clock, trash is
// gone.
//
// What makes a forgotten terminal event safe is NOT the gate's clarify.routed cure
// (which is unreachable on the real write paths — a captured node is always
// already covered by the time routeEvents runs, and clarify.routed removes no
// coverage; see ADR-0029 and test/triage.test.ts). It is that a captured node is
// covered from capture onward, so a bare route leaves it under its capture clock,
// never silent. (The cure IS reachable in the abstract — a bare clarify.routed at
// a never-created node id mints a silent node the cure then clocks — which is why
// it is kept; it just never fires for a route built here.)
//
// These build events; they never touch the store. `app.ts` hands them to
// `session.commit`, which runs them through the gate.
