// The replan surface — product law 3 made visible (ADR-0012, ADR-0034).
//
// **This is not a list of things you failed to do.** No such list exists in this
// app. A hard date that went by becomes a live decision with its context already
// assembled, because by the time a date is behind you the real question is
// "should I still do this, and by when?" — and a bucket answers neither half.
//
// Two shapes, deliberately:
//  - The SURFACE is three quiet rows. Five options on each would be fifteen
//    buttons on one screen, which is the pile in a new costume, and this audience
//    is exactly the one for whom that is expensive.
//  - The SHEET is one item, its context, and the five options at full size with
//    their consequences spelled out. A native <dialog>, so the platform gives us
//    the modal semantics, Esc and the focus trap rather than us reimplementing
//    them badly — the same choice the detail sheet made.
//
// The options are built from REPLAN_CHOICES rather than written into the markup,
// so the surface cannot offer something the intent layer does not implement, and
// cannot drift from ADR-0012's order.
