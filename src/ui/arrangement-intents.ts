// Making, marking and confirming an arrangement.

// The events, and nothing else — no DOM, no store. Every one of them is an
// existing kind: `node.field.set` carries the marker exactly as the comms sweep
// does (ADR-0042), so the closed vocabulary in docs/event-vocabulary.md gains a
// FIELD and not a noun.
//
// Confirming is an ordinary `done.marked`. That is the whole trick: the decay
// primitive already knows how to hold "this came round again", and an
// arrangement is that same rhythm asking whether the arrangement still stands.
