// Folding a duplicate (1.7.0, ADR-0053) — the UI for the vocabulary's
// seventh capability that was complete and unreachable: `node.merged` has
// folded and gated since Phase 0 with nothing able to emit it.
//
// A bare `node.merged` is a data-loss verb (scouted, verified): the source's
// children orphan into Review with the words "what it belonged to was let go"
// — a lie, nothing was let go — and its note, demand clocks, and people links
// vanish from every surface, because every projection excludes merged nodes
// and none follows the chain to combine. So the merge INTENT is a batch:
// carried facts first, children re-homed, then the merge. Folding a duplicate
// must never swallow a date (law 3), a note, a person, or a child.
//
// The way back is `node.unmerged` — split back out, gate-cured like untrashed.
// It restores the node's own STANDING, not the world before the merge:
// carried facts and re-homed children stay where the merge put them, and the
// words say so. (Un-carrying would mean deleting facts from the target, and
// this log does not delete.)
//
// These build events; they never touch the store.
