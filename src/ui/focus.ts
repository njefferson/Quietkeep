// The focus surface: one thing, and a way to be interrupted without losing it.
//
// Everything structural is in `src/focus.ts` (pure) and `focus-intents.ts`
// (events). This module is only the rendering and the wiring, which is where it
// belongs — a surface that computes is a surface that disagrees with the tests.
//
// The elapsed line ticks on a timer, and that timer is the only thing in the app
// that runs on its own. It is bounded by the section being visible and it writes
// nothing: a clock that logged would turn "how long have I been at this" into a
// stream of events nobody asked for.
