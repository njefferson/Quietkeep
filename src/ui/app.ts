  // that never falls is a nag rather than information, which the badge comment

  // own coverage from the inside, so you never know what you are NOT thinking
  // of. Only a promise about the CONTAINER answers that, and it has to be
  // checkable cheaply, at any moment. That promise is law 1, enforced at the
  // write boundary, and it was third in a line behind two counts, in a word the
  // app never defined anywhere: "silent" appeared in no user-facing copy at all.
  //
  // `ready now` STAYS, and not for symmetry. It is the number on the app icon,
  // and the badge is unexplained without a surface that says it — a red 1 on a
  // home screen with no 1 to be found inside is the one thing this app must
  // never be. It is also the only count here that moves in both directions.
  //
