// Everything the user reads is set with textContent. Every control is a real
// <button> at full target size, keyboard-first, and the current item is
// announced in a live region so a screen-reader user is told what they are
// triaging. Activating a control removes it (the card advances), so focus is

   *  an unsorted capture is covered the instant it is written, `whyCovered`
   *  returns 'clock' for it, and it is counted in the proof like everything
   *  else. Nothing is at risk of going quiet while it sits here.
   *
   *  So what the reveal actually did was charge a decision for arriving. That is
