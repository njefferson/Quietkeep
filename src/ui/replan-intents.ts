// Resolving a replan card (ADR-0012, product law 3).
//
// Every option is FORWARD-FACING. There is deliberately no "mark as missed",
// because that is filing rather than deciding, and filing is what produces the
// bucket law 3 forbids.
//
// `replan.resolved` is silent-risk and gated: the chosen option must itself set a
// clock or land the item on the Menu, so there is no resolution that produces
// silence (ADR-0011). Each branch below sets its own destination rather than
// relying on the gate to decide one — the same principle as the clarify routes
// (ADR-0029): the choice knows where the item belongs and a generic cure does not.
//
// That is NOT the same as saying the gate stays out of it, and an earlier version
// of this comment claimed it did. Three branches emit `clock.cleared`, which is
// itself silent-risk, so the gate does attach a cure to those batches. For
// `escalate` and `renegotiate` the branch's own `clock.set` wins on LWW and the
// cure is invisible; for `to-menu` the cure is what the node ends up wearing
// (audit). The branch decides WHERE it goes; the gate guarantees it is covered
// while it gets there.
//
// These build events; they never touch the store.
