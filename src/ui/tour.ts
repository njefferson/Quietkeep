// The walkthrough — the first thing a brand-new person sees, and the family's
// first tutorial (the siblings introduce themselves with always-present copy;
// ND Toolbox's own roadmap names the unbuilt item "calm skippable first-run").
//
// It is built to that house style, not to a spotlight-tour convention that would
// cut against it: CALM (a few short steps, no dimming or chasing the cursor),
// SKIPPABLE (Skip is present on every step), and REPLAYABLE (the ⓘ panel has a
// control that shows it again). It is a modal like the ⓘ panel is — Quietkeep's
// own surface pattern — and it is fully keyboard-operable, moves focus to each
// step's heading, announces the step in a live region, and animates nothing, so
// reduced-motion is honoured by having no motion to reduce.
//
// It ends by handing off to the real first action: opening the ⓘ panel so the
// person can keep their data (the V-00 storage nudge the auto-open used to do),
// with the capture box one tap away.
