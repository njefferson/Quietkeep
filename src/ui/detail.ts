// The detail sheet — what turns a triage loop into a planner (Phase 3.5).
//
// Tap anything you are holding and you can give it a date, make it repeat, take
// back a completion, put it on the Menu or let it go. Before this, the only
// thing the app could do to an item was route it six ways once, and the decay
// primitive had no path into it at all.
//
// One sheet, one item, every control a real <button> at full target size. It is
// a native <dialog>, so the platform gives us the modal semantics, Esc, and the
// focus trap rather than us reimplementing them badly.
//
// Only what is POSSIBLE for this item is shown: offering "Bring back from the
// Menu" for something that is not on the Menu would be a button that either does
// nothing or does something surprising, and this audience is exactly the one for
// whom a surprising control is expensive.
