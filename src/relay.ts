// The relay (sync stage 3, ADR-0037).
//
// **This is not part of Quietkeep.** Nothing in `src/ui` imports it, it is not in
// the bundle, and the app works exactly as it does today with the relay absent,
// unreachable or shut down forever. It belongs to the Sync sibling — a separate
// product with its own deployment, because it trades away "no server" and
// Doctrine §1 says a sibling that trades the promise does not get to hide inside
// the app that keeps it.
//
// ## What it is
//
// A mailbox per sync id, holding **sealed chunks** for a while. A device drops
// off what it has written; other devices pick it up whenever they next open. That
// is the whole design, and it is store-and-forward on purpose: **the other device
// is usually shut.** A protocol that needed both devices awake at once would be a
// protocol that works on the demo and not on Tuesday.
//
// ## What it is NOT
//
// **Not a store of record.** Every device keeps its own complete local log; the
// relay holds copies that expire. Losing the relay, or the key, costs the ability
// to exchange — it cannot cost anybody their work, which is what keeps law 9
// intact. It also means this file may be careless about durability and must be
// careful about confidentiality, which is the opposite of the usual server.
//
// **Not authenticated, and it does not need to be.** The only credential is the
// sync id, which is 128 bits derived from the key by one-way hash. There is no
// route that lists ids and no route that lists anything without one. Someone who
// guesses an id can write junk into a mailbox, read sealed bytes they cannot
// open, and empty the mailbox — and that is the entire consequence, because none
// of it can LOSE anybody's work: every device keeps its full local log, so a
// hostile write, delete or jam costs at most a re-upload. That is why the
// contents are sealed before they ever get here rather than protected by a login,
// and why a delete route is safe to add for revocation despite being unauthored.
//
// ## The one structural guarantee
//
// It refuses anything that is not shaped like a sealed message (`malformedSeal`,
// imported rather than restated — one concept, one place). So it cannot be turned
// into a general-purpose host by a client that simply POSTs a file. It **cannot
// verify that a body is genuinely encrypted**, and it is not asked to: it has
// never held a key and never will. Stated plainly here because the difference
// between "refuses non-seals" and "proves everything is encrypted" is exactly the
// kind of gap a security claim likes to hide in.
//
// PURE, apart from what is injected: the store, the clock and the randomness.
