// The person lens (v1 Must).
//
// `person.created`, `person.linked`, `waiting.opened` and `waiting.closed` have
// been in the vocabulary from the start. Only `person.created` was ever folded,
// and nothing could emit even that — so clarify's "Waiting for" route changed a
// node's kind to say *someone else owes you this* and never asked who.
//
// That is the gap this closes, and the reason it matters is not filing. It is
// that "what am I waiting on Sam for" is a question you get asked out loud, in a
// corridor, with no time to look anything up. Work sorted by project cannot
// answer it. This is the same set of nodes, sliced the way the question arrives.
//
// PURE. `now` and `zone` are arguments.
