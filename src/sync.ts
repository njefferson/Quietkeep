// Exchange when it opens (sync stage 3b, ADR-0037).
//
// The driver: what a device actually does when it comes up. It is the seam where
// the three tested pieces meet — `exchange.ts` for what is held and what is
// missing, `seal.ts` so nothing legible leaves, `relay.ts` for the mailbox — and
// it deliberately adds no new correctness of its own beyond the ordering.
//
// **No UI, no timers, no network primitives.** The transport is injected as three
// methods, so this is testable with a fake wire and stays testable when the
// transport changes. PURE apart from what is injected.
//
// ## What it must never do
//
// **Never lose an event to a failed exchange.** Every step is ordered so that a
// crash leaves the device with strictly more than it had, never less: events are
// admitted and persisted BEFORE the mark that records them is advanced, so a
// death in between costs one repeated download and nothing else. The reverse
// order would silently drop a chunk forever, and there is no error to notice
// afterwards — the shape of every data-loss bug this project has found.
//
// **Never mark an unopenable chunk as taken in.** A chunk sealed by a newer
// format is not garbage; it is a device that is ahead. Recording it as ingested
// would discard it permanently at the exact moment an update would have made it
// readable. It is left alone, retried on every open, and expires on its own.
//
// **Never announce a maximum as completeness.** The mark carries a `Held` — the
// same coalesced ranges `exchange.ts` publishes — and not a high-water number.
// A number here would re-introduce the bug stage 1 exists to prevent, one layer
// up, where it would be even harder to see.
//
// **Never re-run the gate on what arrives.** This driver first carried an
// `admit` hook whose comment said law 1 was enforced on wire events "exactly as
// on a keystroke". It read as the principled choice and it was wrong three ways,
// each checked against the gate rather than assumed (`test/take-in.test.ts`):
// admitting an already-cured log writes a SECOND cure with the same derived id,
// which the store refuses at the append; a chunk delivered twice is refused as a
// creation landing on a node that already exists; and a `node.parented`,
// `dependency.declared` or `node.renamed` whose subject is in the next chunk is
// refused outright, which over a wire is ordinary rather than a fault. What
// arrives is already-gated history and is taken in as a shard (`takeInEvents`,
// ADR-0035) — the same road the import button uses.
//
// **Identity is the event id, never `device#seq`.** A cure shares both with its
// cause, so the coarse key silently drops half of every capture.
