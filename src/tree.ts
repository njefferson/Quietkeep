// The containment tree: what a thing belongs to, and what may legally hold it.
//
// The app shipped with a parent FIELD and no way to set one. Every capture was a
// flat action, so law 4 ("levels push down") had nothing to push down through,
// and the stalled half of Review — a container with no live work under it —
// could never fire, because containers could not be made. This module is the
// arithmetic that closes both.
//
// PURE. It reads state and returns facts; it writes nothing.
//
// The one invariant with teeth: **the parent graph is acyclic by construction**.
// A cycle is not a mistake to report afterwards, it is a claim that a thing is
// inside itself — every walk over the tree becomes infinite and no fold, export,
// projection or render can defend against it individually. So the gate refuses
// the write, and the picker never offers the option in the first place. Offering
// an illegal choice and rejecting it afterwards is a control that lies about
// what it does.
