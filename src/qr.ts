// A QR encoder, for showing a pairing link on one screen so another device's camera
// can read it (sync stage 4, ADR-0037).
//
// the QR route was chosen and then asked after. It was nowhere: recorded as a
// decision and not built, because I had gated all of it behind [V-16] — whether an
// iPad can *read* a code. That was the wrong boundary. Reading is blocked; SHOWING is
// not, and this is the showing half.
//
// ## Why hand-written rather than a library
//
// This app has one runtime dependency (Dexie) and takes another only for correctness.
// A QR generator is a screen shown perhaps twice in a device's lifetime, and a
// general library carries every version, every mode and every error level — a large
// supply-chain surface for a fixed 70-character URL. One version, one mode, one
// level is a few hundred lines that can be read in full.
//
// ## WHAT CI CAN AND CANNOT PROVE — read this before trusting it
//
// Provable here, and proved:
//   - GF(256) arithmetic, against the field axioms rather than a table somebody typed;
//   - the Reed-Solomon codeword, against its DEFINING property — every syndrome is
//     zero, which is checkable from first principles and catches any error in the
//     generator polynomial or the remainder;
//   - the total codeword count, DERIVED geometrically from the module count rather
//     than looked up, so a wrong version or a miscounted function pattern shows up as
//     a stream that does not fill the matrix exactly;
//   - the structure: finders, separators, timing, alignment, the dark module, both
//     copies of the format information, and a data region filled exactly once;
//   - a round trip through the reader in this file.
//
// **NOT provable here**: that a real scanner reads it. In particular the DATA/EC
// SPLIT for a given version and level comes from the specification's tables, and a
// wrong split produces a well-formed-looking matrix that every scanner rejects — the
// round trip in this file would still pass, because it would be wrong in the same way
// in both directions. That is [V-17], and one photograph settles it. Nothing here
// claims otherwise, and the pairing screen must not ship as "working" until somebody
// has pointed a camera at it.
//
// Single-block versions only. Multi-block interleaving needs a per-version table I
// would be reciting rather than deriving, so anything that would need it is REFUSED
// loudly instead of guessed at.
//
// PURE. No DOM, no canvas, no clock.
