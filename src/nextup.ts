// ranking is a fixed precedence, not a score to tune:
//
//   1. HARD LANDSCAPE — a real date has arrived. An appointment does not
//      negotiate with a plant that wants watering, so nothing computed is ever

//   2. RESUME CARDS — the thread you were already pulling. Picking up where you
//      were is cheaper than starting something new, and for this audience the
//      cost of a cold start is the whole problem. Phase 4 creates these; ranking
//      and retirement (spent/expired) are handled, but the cue and the pairing
//      are not built yet, so this is not a finished feature — only a place kept
//      honestly.
//   3. PRESSURE — the decay primitive, highest first (ADR-0010).
//
// **"Not this" cycles freely and records nothing.** No event, no penalty, no
// memory. If declining a suggestion wrote anything down, the surface would be
// keeping score, and a person who has to justify skipping something will avoid
// opening the app at all. Cycling is just an index moving.
//
// PURE, and `now` is an argument.

 * both sections from the same state with no dedup — so the same title appeared
 * twice on one screen, with the same words and two separate Done buttons writing
 * to the same node. For a COGA-informed surface whose entire promise is "one
 * thing", showing the one thing twice is a defect, not a redundancy.
 *
 * REPLAN ITEMS ARE REMOVED FOR A DIFFERENT REASON, and it is the sharper one.
 * An item whose hard date went by qualifies here as `hard-date` — "a real date,
 * and it is here" — while the replan surface above is asking "should this still
 * happen, and by when?". Those are not two views of one item; they are two
 * different questions, and answering the easy one ("do it now") is exactly the
 * move that produced the passed date. Law 3 says the passed date becomes a
 * decision, so the decision is the only thing offered.
 *
 * The exclusion is UNCAPPED while the replan surface shows at most three. The
 * remainder are not lost: `heldGroups` is the complete inventory and still
 * carries them, and the replan surface states the true total, so the cap is
 * bounded re-entry (law 8) rather than a hiding place.
