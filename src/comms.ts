// The comms sweep (v1 Must, build-plan item 22).
//
// Deferred out of Phase 3 with a reason recorded at the time — *"needs focus
// ramps, which are Phase 4"*. Focus ramps shipped in 0.14.0, so the reason is
// spent and this is the thing it was waiting for.
//
// The problem it solves is not "check your email". It is that messages arrive
// continuously and attention does not divide. Left to itself, the habit becomes
// a check every few minutes — each one cheap, all of them together the whole
// day — and for this audience the cost of resuming after each interruption is
// the part nobody budgets for.
//
// So the sweep is ONE bounded pass, offered at the moment you are already
// surfacing: **coming out of a focus session.** You have just put something
// down; that is when looking costs least. Never mid-focus, and never as a
// notification, because a chip that arrives while you are working is the exact
// interruption it exists to consolidate.
//
// It runs on the ordinary decay primitive — `(last_done, comfort_window, rising
// pressure)` — because a sweep is upkeep, and upkeep is what this app already
// knows how to hold without nagging. There is no separate timer, no streak, and
// **not sweeping is not a failure**.
//
// PURE. `now` and `zone` are arguments.
