// one. The content is THE LOG (plus a snapshot for fast restore) — not a
// rendering of current state, because a state snapshot alone would silently
// discard everything that led to it (ADR-0006).
//
// RESTORING ALWAYS SEEDS A FRESH STORE. There is no merge, no "smart import",
// no conflict UI, and no `import.merged` event — adding one would break law 9.
//
// FOLDING IN ANOTHER DEVICE'S SHARD is a different operation and is additive
// (ADR-0035). It is not the merge law 9 forbids: that means resolving two
// versions of one state, which cannot be done honestly. This is the union of
// single-writer shards, which is what ADR-0003 has always said the fold is —
// each device writes only its own events, so two shards cannot disagree about
// what happened, and per-field last-writer-wins already settles what is
// currently true. The two operations are separate functions with separate
// controls saying separate things.

 * Running `admit` again here would, all three verified against the gate in
 * `test/take-in.test.ts` rather than reasoned about:
 *
 *   - mint a SECOND cure for each cause, carrying the same derived
 *     `<cause>~cure~<node>` id — not rejected, just written, and then refused by
 *     the store's unique index at the append;
 *   - refuse a shard taken in twice, as a creation landing on a node that
 *     already exists — the ordinary case for anyone using two devices;
 *   - refuse a `node.parented`, `dependency.declared` or `node.renamed` whose
 *     subject has not arrived yet, which is legal history split across chunks.
 *
 * Law 1 is preserved not by re-checking but because the log being folded in
 * already satisfies it, and the fold of two law-1-satisfying shards satisfies it
 * too: every node arrives with whatever put it on a surface. That is what makes
 * single-writer shards unionable at all (ADR-0003, ADR-0035).
