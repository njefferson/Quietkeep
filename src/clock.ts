// The header clock (1.22.0) — three facts, none of them invented.
//
// Requested as an analog clock in the chrome, to fight time blindness. A dial
// on its own reads NOW, and time blindness is not ignorance of the current time
// — docs/nd-collisions.md entry 4: the future carries no weight until it
// becomes now, so a thing at four o'clock is weightless at two and an emergency
// at ten past four, with nothing in between.
//
// What gives the day weight is watching it drain. So the clock carries the
// REMAINDER as well as the time: how much of today is left, as a plain number
// of hours and minutes. A shrinking remainder is the gradient the decay
// primitive gives to everything else, applied to the day itself.
//
// ## What it deliberately does NOT say
//
// It does not count down to an appointment, because this app does not know when
// anything happens. Every clock here is DAY-GRANULAR: `clock.set` takes a
// datetime, and every writer builds it with `endOfLocalDay`. There is no time
// input anywhere in the app. "Your nine o'clock is in 1h 40m" would therefore
// be a fabricated number, which is exactly what ADR-0010 refuses — and the
// export path is one-way, so nothing can be read back from a calendar either.
//
// A count of what is dated today is honest and is included. A LIST is not: the
// header is chrome, and a list in it would be a second work surface competing
// with the one below it.
//
// PURE. `now` and `zone` are arguments.

/**
 * Open things whose clock lands on today's local day.
 *
 * Only the clocks a PERSON set — `CALENDAR_KINDS`, the same set the calendar
 * export uses. A `review` clock is the app talking to itself: the write gate
 * cures every newly created node with one, so counting them would report a
 * thing filed for next Friday as dated today, purely because it was made this
 * afternoon. That exact confusion is already on the record in this repo, found
 * on a real device when a review clock won the soonest-clock contest and named
 * the wrong day.
 *
 * Completed things are excluded: a thing done today is not still ahead of you.
 *
 * AND SO IS ANYTHING THE CALENDAR REFUSES TO CARRY. `exportsToCalendar` exists,
 * in its own words, as ONE predicate read by the file and the count so the (i)
 * panel can never state a number the file does not hold — and this is a third
 * reader of the same question, so it uses the same predicate rather than a
 * private version that agrees today.
 *
 * Its two exclusions matter more here than they do in an export, because this
 * number sits in the chrome of every screen:
 *
 *   - A worry never counts. A bother's only clocks are the flow's own, and
 *     "keep an eye on this" is not a thing dated today.
 *   - A standing decline never counts. ADR-0056's whole relief is that a park
 *     never demands — "no notification, no banner, no badge" — and a header
 *     number that ticks up on the day a declined request's park lands is a
 *     badge, about the very thing you said no to. That is the exact nag the
 *     ledger exists to remove, rebuilt in the one place nobody can look away
 *     from.
 *
 * TOTAL, for the same reason the remainder is: one unparseable instant in the
 * store — a shard folded in from another device, a hand-edited export — would
 * otherwise throw out of the refresh chain and take every other surface with
 * it. A clock that cannot be read is skipped and the count carries on.
