// The diagnostic report — text you can send when something is wrong
// (1.18.0, Doctrine §7f, ADR-0071).
//
// ## Why this exists, and why it was owed
//
// (Owed, not the other word — the banned-vocabulary gate caught this comment
// on its first run, correctly. `people.ts` records the same trap from Phase 3:
// the comment gets reworded, never the gate widened.)
//
// `docs/data-constitution.md` has promised this to the reader since it was
// written: *"If something breaks, you may choose to copy a diagnostic report.
// It is generated on request, shown to you in full before it goes anywhere, and
// you send it."* Nothing built it. The only diagnostic in the app was the build
// stamp in the footer, whose own comment calls itself one. A commitment the
// product makes to its reader and does not keep is the 1.9.1 class exactly.
//
// Doctrine §7f then made it a rule for every app: **ask for the diagnostic,
// never for a screenshot.** A photograph of a screen loses every reason string
// and cannot show internal state at all — and reports come from an iPad, where
// every outstanding verification in this repo has to be run.
//
// ## THE RULE THIS MODULE IS BUILT AROUND: shape, never content
//
// Other apps' diagnostics worry about location. This one's worry is the
// opposite and sharper. Quietkeep's entire promise is that nothing readable
// leaves the device, and it holds an encrypted journal. A report carrying
// titles, people's names, notes or entry text would break that promise **in a
// file whose whole purpose is to be sent to somebody** — the one artefact in
// the app designed to leave.
//
// So this reports counts, kinds, clock kinds, versions, storage numbers and
// states. **Never a title, never a name, never a note, never plaintext.** It is
// the `reentry.greeted` correction from 1.17.4 restated as a design rule:
// record WHETHER and HOW MANY, never WHICH. `test/diagnostic.test.ts` sweeps a
// store full of distinctive strings and asserts none of them appears here, so
// the rule is falsifiable rather than merely intended.
//
// **And therefore no opt-in to include content.** §7f asks for coarsening with
// an explicit opt-in to include the precise thing; the honest answer here is
// that there is no diagnostic question a title would answer. When a specific
// defect needs the data, **the export already IS the reproduction case** — the
// constitution says so in the same paragraph, and `deliverCopy` builds it. This
// report points at that instead of duplicating it, and says so in its own
// words rather than leaving it implied.
//
// ## It leads with the diagnosis (§7f)
//
// Root causes first, separated from what they knocked over, and it says what is
// MISSING and why rather than merely that it is missing. A silent node is not a
// symptom — it is law 1 failing, and everything downstream of it is consequence.
//
// PURE. Every reading is an argument: no storage, no clock, no DOM, no
// `navigator`. The UI gathers, this shapes.

 *
 * It exists because of a store read from a device: 1,432 things, one place, no
 * people. Answering *where are you* returned that one place's things plus every
 * unlabelled one, which is all of them — correct, and load-bearing, since a
 * filter that can empty the screen is a filter nobody trusts twice. But the
 * person who answers and sees nothing change cannot tell whether the feature is
 * broken, whether they did it wrong, or whether it is working exactly as
 * designed on a store with nothing to bite on. This report is the artefact
 * built for that moment and it could not say.
 *
 * NEVER A FINDING, and that is a decision rather than an oversight. Filing is
 * optional in this app, always — the manual promises it in those words — so a
 * low number here is a fact about a store and not a fault in anybody. Putting
 * it under WHAT IS WRONG would be scoring somebody for using the product as
 * promised, which is law 5.
 *
 * EVERY PREDICATE IS THE FILTER'S OWN. `reachedByAPlace` is the negation of
 * `fitsHere`'s "fits every answer" clause, `namedOn` is the list `fitsWith`
 * branches on, `estimateOf` is what `fitsWithin` reads. Counting a second
 * reading of the same fields would let the census and the behaviour disagree
 * about one store, which is the defect this whole file exists to make visible.
