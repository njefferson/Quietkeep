// The calendar file — T1, and the only tier that actually reminds you
// (build-plan item 30, [ADR-0007](../docs/adr/0007-notification-tiers.md)).
//
// Everything built so far only brings something back WHILE THE APP IS OPEN, and
// the thesis says the return "is not a feature — it is the structural property
// the whole schema exists to guarantee". Depending on the user to remember to
// look is depending on exactly the capacity this app compensates for.
//
// So the job is handed to the OS calendar, which already has notification
// permission, already runs when this app does not, and works on every platform
// including iOS in the EU — with **no server**, which is part of what this app
// is. Unglamorous, and the only mechanism that works everywhere.
//
// PURE. `now` and `zone` are arguments, like every other projection here.
//
// HONESTY, required by ADR-0007: a `.ics` is a POINT-IN-TIME SNAPSHOT. If a
// clock changes in the app the exported calendar is stale, and the app must say
// so rather than implying the calendar is live. Both the calendar name and every
// event description carry the moment they were made.
