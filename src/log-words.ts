// One plain-words line per event (1.4.0) — the log viewer's and the per-node
// history's shared voice.
//
// Every fact in this app folds from the log, and until now there was no way to
// look at it. These lines are how the record reads back as sentences: calm,
// past-tense, subject-free — the SURFACE says which item a line is about, so
// the words say only what happened to it. "You" did the deliberate acts; "the
// app" owns its own (cures, snapshots, migrations), because a record that
// blurs who did what is a record that cannot answer "did I choose this?".
//
// CONTENT NEVER RIDES ALONG. A note body, a journal entry, a capture's full
// text — the line says one was written, never what it said: the log view is a
// list of a thousand lines and a screenshot surface, and prose belongs on the
// item's own sheet. Titles referenced BY an event (a parent, a merge target, a
// person) come through the caller's `titleOf`, so the line can say where a
// thing went in the reader's own words.
//
// The map is TOTAL over EVENT_KINDS — a totality test holds it there — and the
// fallback for anything unmapped names the kind verbatim rather than guessing:
// an honest raw label beats a wrong sentence.
//
// PURE. The zone is an argument, like everywhere else (V-13).
