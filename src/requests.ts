// Request slots and the Not Now ledger (1.8.0, ADR-0056).
//
// Two ideas, one module, both from the thesis's stimulus-control section:
// declining someone's request is a DECISION WORTH KEEPING (the ledger — "the
// thing to point at when the same request comes back"), and a request slot is
// a scheduled place for requests to WAIT, so they are not evaluated at
// arrival. The scheduling does the work; nothing detects, counts, or nags.
//
// The line this module must never blur (ADR-0042, restated in ADR-0056): the
// ledger records declines of OTHERS' requests. A record of the times you did
// not do your own work is the ledger this app exists to NOT keep — the do-now
// offer's "Not now" writes nothing, ever.
//
// PURE. `now` and `zone` are arguments, like every projection here.
