// Coming back after being away (product law 8: **rest is legitimate**).
//
// `lapse.migration.ran`, `reentry.greeted`, `amnesty.offered` and
// `amnesty.accepted` have been in the vocabulary from the first draft, with the
// bound written into the schema itself: *"`reentry.greeted.shown` has room for
// exactly Next-up, at most three triage items, and the gauge. There is no shape
// it could take that shows the backlog."* None of them was folded and nothing
// could emit one — the fifth capability in this app defined completely and
// reachable from nowhere.
//
// This matters more than the count of features suggests. Law 8 calls re-entry
// **the primary designed path**, not an edge case, and NOTES.md defines v1 done
// as thirty consecutive working days. A bad week is not a risk to that gate; it
// is a certainty. What decides whether the gate survives it is what the app does
// on the morning you come back.
//
// So the greeting shows a bounded, fixed set and **cannot be made to show the
// pile**. Not by configuration, not by a long absence, not by having a thousand
// items. The shape is the guarantee.
//
// PURE. `now` and `zone` are arguments.
