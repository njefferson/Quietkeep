// This lives in its own module for a dull but load-bearing reason: `nextup.ts`
// imports `replan.ts` (the work surface excludes anything with a live card), so
// `replan.ts` cannot import back without a cycle — and a cycle over a `const`
// export is a TDZ `undefined` at module-evaluation time, which is a silent wrong
// answer rather than a loud failure. One neutral home, imported by both.
//
// The two sets are DIFFERENT, and the difference is the point. "Can this be
// offered as the next thing to do?" and "can a date have gone by on this?" are
// not the same question, and answering them with one list would be wrong in one
// direction or the other.

 * you is a real decision — arguably the one most worth making — and three of the
 * five options (move the date, pick a new one, not now) are exactly right for

 * its reason: Next-up excludes it because *you* cannot act on it, which says
 * nothing about whether the date matters.
 *
 * `resume-card` is ADDED. It is the app's own artifact rather than a commitment
 * a person made, and "this needs someone else" is meaningless about one.
 *
 * Without this set an Area with a due date was refused by Next-up under law 4
 * and simultaneously offered five buttons here, one of which converted it into a
 * waiting-for (audit).
