// The decay primitive — the one temporal mechanism (ADR-0010, product law 5).
//
//     (last_done, comfort_window, rising pressure)
//
// Everything temporal in this app is the same shape: something was last touched
// at T, it is comfortable for a while, and after that it comes back with
// increasing insistence. Modelling an Upkeep interval, an area's review clock
// and a parked bother's return separately would produce four subtly different
// notions of "late" that drift apart, and four places to fix a bug.
//
// PRESSURE IS COMPUTED, NEVER STORED. It cannot go stale and it cannot disagree
// with the log. It is continuous and unbounded above, with NO thresholds baked
// into storage — what a surface chooses to show at what value is a presentation
// decision that can change without a migration.
//
// **There is no "overdue" here, and there will not be one.** Not a state, not a
// boolean, not a variable name. A binary late/not-late is a cliff, and cliffs
// print their own geometry into the interface instead of the data's. Worse, for
// this audience that word is a shame surface, shame produces avoidance, and
// avoidance is what made the thing late in the first place — an app that marks
// work that way is participating in the loop it exists to interrupt. The name
// for pressure >= 0 is **"ready again"**. No red walls. No streaks, ever.
//
// PURE. `now` is an argument, like everywhere else.

 * Continuous pressure for an item that carries the primitive, or `null` for one
 * that does not (pressure is meaningless without a cadence — those items rank by
 * their clock instead, and asking for a number here would invent one).
 *
 * The scale, which is the whole point of it being one primitive:
 *
 * ```
 *   < 0   still comfortable — nothing is being asked of you
 *  === 0   ready again
 *   > 0   rising insistence, measured in comfort windows past ready
 * ```
 *
 * `1` means a full comfort window past ready, `2` two of them, and it keeps
 * going — unbounded, so nothing has to be clamped into a worst state and no
 * cliff exists to render.
 *
 * A comfort window is PER ITEM (ADR-0010): watering a plant and calling your
 * mother do not share a tolerance, so the same lateness in days is not the same
 * pressure. That is exactly what dividing by the item's own window expresses.
