// Review, done as EXCEPTIONS ONLY (v1 Must: stalled/orphan detection).
//
// The classic weekly review asks you to look at everything. That is precisely
// the thing this audience cannot do, and the reason most review habits die: the
// cost is paid up front, every time, whether or not anything is wrong.
//
// So this surface never shows you your work. It shows you the four things that
// are structurally broken and nothing else — and when nothing is broken it is
// not there at all. An empty review is the normal state and it says so by its
// absence, not by a congratulation (law 5: nothing here is a score).
//
// **Stalled** — something that contains work, with no live piece of work under
// it. A project with no next action is the single most expensive silent failure
// in any planner: it looks fine on every surface, and nothing happens.
//
// **Orphaned** — a node whose parent is gone. The gate refuses to CREATE one
// (law 1), but a parent can be trashed later by a path that cured the children
// differently, and a shard exchange can deliver a child whose parent never
// arrived. So it is detected as well as prevented — the invariant is checked,
// not assumed.
//
// **Quiet area** (`dormant` in ADR-0013's vocabulary, 1.6.0) — an area that
// HOLDS live work where nothing has finished in a month. Distinct from
// stalled: stalled has nothing that could move, a quiet area has plenty and
// none of it is moving. The words are shame-free by design — a dormant
// perennial has not failed (ADR-0020); rest is legitimate, and the question
// is only whether it is rest.
//
// **Unfed goal** (`unsupported goal` in ADR-0013's vocabulary, 1.6.0) — a goal
// with nothing live beneath it feeding it. A goal is a stated direction, and a
// direction nothing serves is a decision waiting: feed it, or let it be a wish
// on the Menu. (Named "unfed" in code and copy — "unsupported" is a banned
// token in the update-copy gate, and one word with two meanings in one
// codebase is a collision waiting.)
//
// PURE. `now` and `zone` are arguments.
