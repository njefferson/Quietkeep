 * (Gollwitzer) — bind a cue to an action in advance, so the action fires on
 * noticing the cue rather than on self-initiation, which is the step that
 * fails. Gawrilow & Gollwitzer found if-then plans brought inhibition in
 * children with ADHD to the level of children without it; Toli, Webb & Hardy's
 * meta-analysis found a medium effect on goal attainment. It is among the very
 * few things in this literature with experimental ADHD evidence rather than
 * self-report.
 *
 * The prediction for planners is blunt: a task stored as a NOUN recruits
 * nothing. Even a well-formed next action — verb plus object — is only the
 * THEN. The "if" is the active ingredient, and no schema here had a place to
 * put it. Neither did any planner surveyed.
 *
 * ONE FIELD, FOUR JOBS, which is why it is a string and not a structure:
 *  - the implementation-intention "if";
 *  - an event-based retrieval cue, which is the intact channel — a datetime is
 *    the least retrievable anchor there is and was the only one this app had;
 *  - where a routine's chaining lives, in the person's own words;
 *  - somewhere to put an alternate for when the plan breaks, since the deficit
 *    at that moment is generating options rather than choosing between them.
 *
 * WHAT IT MUST NEVER BECOME. Self-generated only — the evidence rests on plans
 * the person wrote, and there is no reason to think an assistant-written one
 * works. Never required, never validated for form ("your plan should start
 * with When…"), never counted, and never asked whether it worked. A coverage
 * figure for it would be a completion percentage wearing a hat.
