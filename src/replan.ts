// Replan cards — product law 3, "no past bucket" (ADR-0012).
//
// **There is no list of things you failed to do.** No "missed", no "overdue"
// list, no archive of what slipped. A passed hard date becomes a LIVE CARD with
// its context already assembled and three forward-facing options.
//
// The reasoning is ADR-0012's and it is worth restating, because the easy
// implementation is the forbidden one: a list of failures is a shame surface,
// and this audience usually has one already. Worse, it is useless — by the time
// something is on it, the real question is "should I still do this, and by
// when?", and a bucket answers neither half. Assembling the context is the
// expensive part and exactly the part someone with temporal myopia cannot
// reconstruct on demand.
//
// ONLY HARD CLOCKS RAISE A CARD. A passed `due` or `suspense` is a real date that
// went by. A passed `review` is the app's own "bring this back" — the gate writes
// those constantly as cures, and treating them as lapses would manufacture the
// exact shame surface law 3 forbids, at a rate of one per capture.
//
// COMPUTED, never stored. ADR-0012 says a replan is "a computed consequence of a
// clock and a current time, so it cannot be missed and cannot go stale". It also
// says "the fold generates replan.raised" — which `fold` structurally cannot do,
// being pure and having no clock. The computed reading is the one that survives;
// ADR-0034 records why.
//
// PURE. `now` and `zone` are arguments.
