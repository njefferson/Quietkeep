// Arrangements — the thing that is supposed to run without you.
//
// A whole class of what people carry is not a task and never becomes one. It is
// an arrangement already made: a supply that reorders itself, a service on a
// schedule, a renewal, a subscription, a delivery. The work was done once, when
// it was set up. After that it is meant to happen on its own.
//
// **Its failure mode is SILENCE**, and that is why it needs a shape of its own.
// A task that does not get done sits there looking undone. An arrangement that
// stops simply produces nothing — no delivery, no reminder, no error — and the
// first signal is running out. For a reader whose future carries no weight
// until it is now (docs/nd-collisions.md entry 4), a signal that arrives only at
// the moment of failure is the worst possible signal, because by then it is an
// emergency and the emergency is the only thing that ever felt real.
//
// So the app holds the QUESTION the arrangement cannot answer for itself:
// *when did I last confirm this is still happening?*
//
// ## Why this is a field, not a new kind
//
// Exactly ADR-0042's reasoning for the comms sweep. An arrangement
// decays, completes, renders as a card and can be turned off — every projection
// in this app already knows how to handle all four. A new kind would mean
// teaching each of them about something they can already hold, and it would open
// the closed event vocabulary for no gain (docs/event-vocabulary.md).
//
// ## What differs, and it is only the question
//
// `lastDone` on an ordinary upkeep means *last time I did this*. On an
// arrangement it means *last time I confirmed this is still arranged*. Same
// field, same decay primitive, same `done.marked` to satisfy it. The difference
// lives in the words, because the difference is what is being asked.
//
// ## The dependency flag
//
// The arrangements that fail hardest are the ones waiting on somebody else who
// will not tell you they have stopped — an approval nobody chased, a lapsed
// authorisation, a card that expired at a company that does not write. Marking
// that is not a category for its own sake: it changes what confirming MEANS,
// because you cannot confirm it from here. The words say so rather than
// pretending a glance is enough.
//
// PURE. `now` and `zone` are arguments.
