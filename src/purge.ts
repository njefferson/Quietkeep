// Clearing things out — a roadmap requirement: the ability to purge the whole
// set of tasks.
//
// How it was required to feel: both modes available, so the person keeps control
// of their own data; a verification step so it cannot be done easily by accident;
// and a backup recommended before it happens, with a button to take one at the
// moment of the decision.
//
// ## Two modes, because they are genuinely different promises
//
// **Clear what I am holding** — every held thing is trashed. The surfaces empty,
// and the log still contains every event that ever happened, so nothing is lost
// and an export taken afterwards still carries the history. This is the mode that
// keeps law 9 unqualified.
//
// **Start again** — the store is replaced with an empty one. The history goes with
// it. This is the only operation in this app that destroys data on purpose, and it
// is therefore the only one that has to be hard to do by accident.
//
// Offering only the first would be dishonest about what people actually want (a
// planner you cannot ever truly empty is a planner accumulating a permanent
// record of a bad month). Offering only the second would make "clear the list" cost
// the history. So: both, named for what they do, and the difference stated in the
// words rather than in a footnote.
//
// ## The verification is a typed word, deliberately not a held button
//
// Hold-to-confirm is a dexterity test, and tremor is a supported condition here —
// a guard that a shaking hand cannot pass is a guard that locks somebody out of
// their own data. Typing a short word is a test of INTENT, which is the thing
// actually being checked.
//
// The two modes take DIFFERENT words, and that is load-bearing: with one shared
// word, typing it for the reversible mode and then switching mode would carry the
// authorisation across to the irreversible one. Somebody would lose their history
// to a control they had already satisfied for something else.
//
// PURE. `now` and the stamping context are injected; nothing here touches a store.

 * being true in 1.7.0 when folding a duplicate shipped — nobody edited the
 * claim because nobody had reason to look at it. Clearing means clearing:
 * everything that has not already been let go is let go, folded or not.
