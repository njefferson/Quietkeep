// The printable today-card (v1.5).
//
// One page, on paper, for when the iPad is not the right object — a meeting
// where a screen is rude, a workshop, a day the battery is going to lose.
//
// **It is a snapshot and it says so.** Paper cannot update, cannot be ticked off
// into the log, and cannot know that you finished something an hour after
// printing it. Every honest thing this app does about the `.ics` export applies
// here in stronger form, so the card carries the moment it was made and says
// plainly that the app is still the place where things are true.
//
// **It is bounded, like every other re-entry-shaped surface.** A page you print
// is a page you will look at when you are already short of attention; printing
// the whole list would produce the pile in a form you cannot even collapse.
//
// PURE. `now` and `zone` are arguments.
